I look down upon the clouds from on high, and wonder at how droplets have arranged themselves, without wanting to, so much more resolutely than any social movement, any uprising, any construct of social elements seems ever to have.  From here, I see into the eye of a massive storm, where white bleeds into a blue cavity.  There is power at that threshold, a colossal turbine.

I've seen, from atop a mountain, a storm pass slowly, deliberately over a valley below.  I've seen storms dutifully cleanse a land scarred by industry.  I've seen storms rip trees from the ground and casually discard them in the path of industry.  I've seen storms compel the tide to crash ashore, pushing salty foam through 15 feet of porous rock, spouting from the top like from a craggy, volcanic whale.

I haven't seen a good storm in a long time.  I imagine some mythic land where storms gather and rampage and mingle and merge, &#252;berstorms.  These are our giants, and I miss them.
