- The prospect of halting study makes every other thing I'm going harder.

- I can't fucking believe I'm going to quit.  Again.

- Yeah, "temporarily."  Well, temporarily is predicated on the presumption that conditions may change sufficiently to allow me to go back.  Let's see:
   - still married
   - still have kids
   - still have mortgage
   - still have cars
   - still have bills
   - still have job
   - What the fuck is going to change?

- Why am I saw caught up in this, though?  If nothing matters, why does this matter so much?  Yeah, the same old reasons:
   - the higher probability of finding something to generate income that doesn't suck
   - the higher probability of following through on particular trajectories of study with the presence of deadlines
   - the higher probability of following through on particular trajectories of study with the availability of a community of like-minded students

- Is this worth the expense of time spent on other things, though, like reading, philosophy, writing, observing, parenting?
   - I wish it weren't a competition of focus, but it is

- Why should it be so hard, though?  I guess, well, there's a certain logical aspect, a systematic sorting of planned action upon the completion of a prioritization; but there's the tough part: the prioritization.  Once that's done, the rest is easy.  Essentially like the aphorism that says once you figure out what's right, it's actually pretty easy to do.
