We learn by way of analogy, of hopefully isomorphic maps between what we know or believe and the thing to be understood. We would hope for isomorphism, to recreate a thing in the mold with which we're most comfortable without losing information. But there will always be error.

When we explain things, often we choose to explicitly invoke the conversational analogy (which is to say, a statement like "This thing is like this phenomenon" or the like, which makes direct use of the analogical grammatical structure; the alternative is to explain things using only the unconscious or subtle analogy built into our thinking and language, both the sender's and receiver's). This is tricky business, as we are building the grammatical structure atop the necessarily imperfect casting in analogy. We may wish to invoke a comfortably comprehended concept for its structural similarity to our message, but we need realize that the receiver may already have specific and proprietary attachments and analogical derivations from this concept. By invoking this concept, we make the receiver only more confused as they try to map, not from our concept to the (relatively) neutral analogy, but from our concept to their proprietary derivative.

Look no further than discussion of morality, which is almost certain to become circular or divisive unless the conversing parties already share very similar worldviews.

Artists very frequently learn by copying styles, and only later after their own cognitive forces affect the shapes they create do they develop their own. This is building knowledge, cognition, via analogy.

This process is not unlike displacement waves: the water doesn't actually travel laterally or longitudinally, but vertically. The wave can only form from DEforming the form already present.

About the girl in my dreams, for whom I felt s closeness, and which closeness I lamented. And of BSG, and Kara Thrace's leaving, her return to the or some heavens. The bittersweet made more bitter by the knowledge that even it—that emotion—is fleeting and nonrenewable.

Nostalgia's just regret in a wrapper, and derives from a cowardice in the face of decision. It's a wish to retrace steps and take a new path, or the lament that this is impossible. Or it is intimidation in the face of someone else's capacity to make and commit to decisions.

Or, maybe, there's more. Maybe nostalgia and it's sentimentality derive from any collapsing of the possible into the actual, either by our making choices or by circumstance, by things outside our control that we nevertheless lament.

The trouble is—the trouble with arriving at Phaedrus' resolution, mapping Quality to Tao, with arriving at Poincaré's confirmation of Phaedrus' observation that phenomena are always underdetermined, that their are an infinity of equally useful or trivial hypotheses for a given phenomenon—is that we're back where we started, looking for a way to make choices. We are left to decide which corrupt system of decision-making to use. It's all Dadaism all the way down. All formal systems are Turing-incomplete, are undecidable, a la Gödel.

The whole point of BSG.

How does memory, an imperfect system of recording history, affect the neurological analogies, and their descendants?

We are defined by our environment, by those things to which we are attracted. Nothing is isolated. This is all overgeneralized, but meets the needs of my point.

I am easily attracted to many things, and as seems human, become attracted to *being* those things. Again, this seems fine and natural; this is how we are inspired or take ideas from the general pool of them. But there's a point at which any of us (likely) or I (certainly) need to turn that off, and let the idea churn internally, let me develop with these things.

I have trouble with this. If I see someone doing something fascinating, not only do I typically want to do this, I begin defining myself as someone who *should* do this. Mathematicians are astounding; I feel like a caged mathematician, so I need to take classes and open the cage door. 3D artists do some amazing things; time to by the Blender or Lightwave books. Web developers? Learning HTML and CSS and Django and maybe an IDE. Olympic sprinters? Time to train. This is the writerly notebook dilemma recast.

What is not so easily mimicked is the resolve, is the completion of any substantive level of work. Is the doing. Too much time spent stressing over why I'm not a mathematician cum carpenter cum home-maker/cook cum prolific essayist cum <something else>, ad nauseum; too little time doing any one of them.

Human "world" conflated, by analogy from our perspective, from our peering out from within the shell of our conscious experience, with the planet. Perhaps it is the misapplication of attributes of one to the other.

When we write or speak, we are in the most intimate contact with the analogical system possible. The translation of what we say, being a necessary compression of what we're thinking, into thought is so quick there is little time to notice if there is another equally likely translation. Therefore, as most English teachers and writing-tips articles will tell you, write then wait, then review.

Skeuomorphic design banks on existing cognitive metaphors for existing, typically physical objects. The trouble is that the concept of the software may not map well tithe chosen object. This requires one to relearn the physical object in order to understand the software. It may be that software may not be isomorphic to any object in a way that illuminates usage or functionality.

We can none of us know the world. We make sense of the world to which we have access by recognizing, or more accurately inferring, patterns. You may see we author our world, using as raw materials sensations of the external world. This is how we make sense from nonsense, sequitur from non-sequitur. Some games hope to provide for the player a similar sense of authorial sensability. The conflict arises from the authored viewpoint game producers deliver, and the one I am building in the game world myself.

"Our fears of the apocalypse may in the end mirror the most fundamental fear of all: fear of our own mortality. It is all of a piece-death, the dissolution of our people, the extinction of our species. Regardless of how we feel about it, flux is the nature of the world, and endings are an inescapable-and often overlooked-part of life. That is why we chose to devote the lion's share of this issue of Scientific American to the theme of endings. We look at the chance that civilization will fall to pandemic or asteroid, to the loss of indigenous knowledge spread among the cultures of the world, to the declining resources that our planet will struggle to provide."
