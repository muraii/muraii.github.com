It takes some time for people to understand an issue before they can comment. For instance, I require some time to hear and ponder on my wife's concern of curriculum or not, or of a medical thing, or of a social or political idea. What I believe takes time is a deconstructing of the issue at-hand and reassembling of it in units of my cognition. A fitting of the issue over the carapice from which I make my own ideas, which carapice is formed from the combination of those active metaphors I use consciously, as well as the subtler, more fundamental metaphors and sensory patterns and neural substrate which underpin this whole system. The calculus of my cognition, the mechanisms with which I make my decisions, require some sensible input, and it is this that takes me, at least me, time.

This, too, I think, explains my slow reaction time to imminent issues. Consider the man who was beating another a couple of years ago. I exited the bus at my stop, crossed the street, and heard some commotion. Loud talking, yelling, or whatever. I saw a large man talking to a scrawny man, and then punch the latter a few times while the smaller man asked him not to. I stood there and watched, not knowing what to do, thinking about what was best to do, and in the span of a few seconds there was nothing from which to choose. The matter was essentially settled.

The best I can hope from this, I think, is to recall and consider this situation in preparation for another similar that I may face.
