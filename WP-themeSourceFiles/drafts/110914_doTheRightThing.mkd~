<div class="">Rifle stock cracked. Over the last guy's head, which luckily is also cracked. Fortune continues: he carried the same model. Between the two I'll have a serviceable weapon, if only a handful of rounds.

And they're out there, hunting. Hunting for me. No way I've got the shots to take 'em. So I'll wait and consider praying.

Why are they hunting? Guess I have it coming. I saw the first, hid, and decided to put 'im down. Now in the dark hollow of a broken building, my breath caught, I can't piece together why. Not much separates us: we're all of us killers, happier with a loaded piece than without, making off with what we don't own. All thieves and murderers. Guess I bought that I'm somehow special, that my killing and stealing is justified, serving a better end.

What if they think the same thing? What if they live with more than primal purpose? Can't say now, of course. Blood's shed, more to come. And maybe they'd just as soon have drawn on me for the few trinkets I have. But what did Horus say last week? Something like "Shooting first is a good way to justify shooting back." Or the like.</div>

##How Open the World

Several people worked [long hours for years] to craft a world in the shadow of American social and technological mythology. The goal can as much as anything be framed thus: a meditative experiment on freedom.

The apparatus of this experiment is the wasteland of post-nuclear-war America [centuries] after war ravaged fertile land and democracy. What's left is ta hostile landscape of brutal thugs, despotic [oligarchs], and feral irradiated monsters. Few pockets of civilization exist.

The creators of *Fallout {3, :NV}* want to help me write a story. They've provided a world, repleat with physics and simulations of intelligence. I can wander freely, choose how to interact with whom and when, and accept the repercussions of my actions. I am free to help or harm.

Curiously, my first and lasting impulse is to help. A man needs water, which I provide. A boy needs help saving his father. I help. A caravan is under attack by raiders. I intervene and fight them off. At every opportunity, I take on yet more responsibility. I am good.
