I've been a game enthusiast to varying degrees since the '70s. I've played the predictable litany of games, like Galaga, Pac Man, Altered Beast, Golden Axe, Splinter Cell, MSG1-2, Halo, and Gears of War 1. I'm familiar with the predictable litany of gaming systems, including the Atari 2600 (_Yar's Revenge_, please), the Tandy CoCo III (_Dungeon's of Daggorath_, please), the Amiga 500 (_Pool of Radiance_, please), D&D (Basic, Advanced, 2nd Edition, 3rd Edition), PC (_Baldur's Gate_), PS1 (_Resident Evil_), PS2 (_Ico_), Xbox (_Splinter Cell_), and PS3 (_Fallout 3_). Those are among the most memorable titles by platform. I have never been a *gamer*, though, in the sense of someone for whom games are the bedrock of a social.

As I've contemplated what to do with my still-sort-of-newly minted-and-anti-climactic undergraduate degree in mathematics, very often while trying to answer that question posed by other people, I usually settle on a region of solution space comprised of math, science, philosophy, aesthetics, writing, computation, the web, and games. That's a boring, vague, and nearly clich&eacute; starting point, but I'm still learning the landscape and trying to refine my vision.

For instance, I'm writing a text-adventure engine which I plan to make playable via the web. It's currently set in a newly created world the family built (ingredients: several sheets of graph paper, colored pencils, and a few evenings), mostly using common fantasy tropes (e.g., magic, elves, volcanoes, sentient trees, etc.). I have considered developing a literal group dynamic, that is, that some collection of player attributes or interactions forms an algebraic group, with binary operation, identity element, closure, associativity, and invertibility. Not sure how that would play out, but it's an idea. Perhaps this is a pretty obvious kind of thing, perhaps it's known (at least to some) that players organize themselves into algebraic structures naturally. I wouldn't be surprised, given the real-world applicability of those structures in other contexts (e.g., group theory is used all over physics). But making it an explicit element of gameplay feels novel, and is the kind of experimentation I want more of.

I owe part of my relatively recently resurgent interest in games, and somewhat new interest in being a gamer as defined above, to having found Michael Abbot's blog [The Brainy Gamer](http://www.brainygamer.com). Michael writes fluidly, maturely, about games, their implications, and their formation as artistic products. I've found so much worth investigating, so much careful work from other people, who may or may not make or play games, it's hard to encapsulate. [The Brainy Gamer podcast](http://www.brainygamer.com/the_brainy_gamer/podcast/), [the Bethesda podcast](http://www.bethblog.com/podcast/), and [Rebel FM podcast](http://www.eat-sleep-game.com/news/category/rebel-fm-podcast/) are all on heavy rotation right now, with a few others on-deck ([Moving Pixels](http://www.popmatters.com/pm/blogs/moving-pixels/section/moving-pixels-podcast/) [The Game Informer](http://www.gameinformer.com/b/podcasts/default.aspx), and [State of the Game](http://sotg-sc2.blogspot.com/)). There is too much solid material between [Gamasutra](http://www.gamasutra.com), [Kill Screen](http://killscreendaily.com), [Kotaku](http://www.kotaku.com), and an army of independent writers to have any reasonable shot at reading it all. I've found that Miami University has within its [Aims Institute for Interactive Media Studies](http://aims.muohio.edu/) a "digital media and learning research lab," the [Magic Lab](http://www.magic-lab.org). Of the two universities I attended, I much preferred Miami, and I expect this program is fantastic. And even things I'd known about before this resurgence, such as the various engines (Unreal, etc.) and tools (Blender and other 3D applications, game level/environment editors, etc.) take on new meaning: they're not quite the otherworldly artifacts I've previously considered them. They're within my reach.

I'm very eager to find a place in this community. The primary question is: how? Of course I'd love to, for instance, work with Bethesda on Fallout 4, writing, developing art, programming in the Creation Engine. And there is so much work worth investigating critically that I can't help but want to write analyses (more like Tom Bissell and Michael Abbot than buy-or-rent reviews on IGN or GameSpy). This is a clumsy dichotomy, and not quite accurate, but it's helpful nonetheless. Thing is, either direction requires a significant learning curve and a reallocation of my time. I've decided to take small steps, and be patient, but it's so easy to dream of even a modest multiplatform gaming setup and hours every day playing, developing, and writing that impatience is a constant nuisance.
