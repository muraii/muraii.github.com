I never did set out to do anything I wanted. Not as an adult. I have earned my living, in those eras in which I did earn it, doing whatever seemed easiest, most convenient. I have never set my sights on the transmuting of an avocation into a vocation, of making a living doing--as a teacher once described--my "beautiful work."

There are many reasons for this, some I have covered here, some I _will_ cover here, some I may not comment upon publically, and some I cannot yet fathom. One of the more significant is my penchant to maintain a well-stocked pantry of defeatist justifications. I'm always ready to explain why I can't do this thing or that thing, things I earnestly want to be doing with my operative brain time. Like writing.

I hesitate to live like I hesitate to write: I worry that there's some perfect version of whatever I aim to say or do, and more importantly, that I'm doomed to its antithesis. I have no shortage of topics and plots whose details I'd like to pen; and I have no shortage of activities and ventures I would take great pleasure in exercising. But I come to the keyboard or the paper and pen and am suddenly lost, cannot find my way through the ideas that are receding as if lassoed by my fear; and I consider all the ways I might do great work while making a living and find every exception to that plan.

The way through is simple enough. There are no tricks. There is just the slow, arduous reprogramming my brain by doing things, seeing them done, and remarking that despite their imperfections they are still worth having done. "There is no win, there is no fail. There is only make." Still, it's a while before a boy can casually walk to the bed under which he suspects hides a monster. I just hope it's not much longer.
