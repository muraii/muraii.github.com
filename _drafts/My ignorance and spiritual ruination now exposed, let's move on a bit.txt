My ignorance and spiritual ruination now exposed, let's move on a bit. One of the ways I've attempted to jump-start a&mdash;borrowing from Ayn Rand here because I like how she puts it&mdash;motive energy by creating to-do lists and projects and even a mind map or two. Somehow these incantations, designed for folks who have energy and some focus and need some organization, doesn't retroactively generate that energy and focus. As Merlin Mann might say, creating a bullet list of things to accomplish without the will or interest in their actual accomplishment is like buying a couch for running. [Make this not stupid.] So [first care] (link).

In short, this doesn't work. At all. It's worse, actually: the added stress of both managing and failing to meet these objectives strongly exacerbates the sense of looming failure. It adds degrees of failure, like a whole topography of failure, with strata and sediment and below it all the fossils of dreams long ago crushed. Beneath all that is the muck of failure, which may yet be refined into motive energy but which nevertheless almost always creates toxic byproducts.
