When I look at the world, large or small, it's hard not to be cynical. People are a teeming stew of awful or incredible behaviors, habits, and "philosophies." I cringe at re exertion to support some NASCAR driver or soccer team. I flinch when a parent berates a child, even a child who needs some correction. I grimace when a relative tells me he'd help a black man out but wouldn't let him into his church.

I similarly grimace, flinch, and cringe when Oprah helps a family make ends meet, when a hopeful book makes the bestseller list, and when someone goes in about the strength of the human spirit. You guys just can't win.

And I'm a hypocrite, which perhaps undergirds the cynicism. I've been a ravenous sports fan; I've been an abusive father; and I've looked down on a fellow for race or social class. And i've expounded breathlessly about the beauty we're capable of; I've read and written of hope; and I've helped families in need. I'm everything I dislike and have a hard time not projecting a self-dissatisfaction on the rest of you.

Which isn't to say we're not all deserving. We're a cruel, angry, ignorant cancer. But even cancer is beautiful. I'm more than a little conflicted.

Thing is, cynicism is tiring. It requires a lot of energy. And it doesn't serve as much of a motivation to do anything with a life I continue to [choose living]().
