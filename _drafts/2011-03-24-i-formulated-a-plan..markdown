I would understand the layers of cognition so that I might develop a system for controlling it. Yet fan as I am of G&ouml;del's work&mdash;such as I understand it&ouml;I soldiered on, supposing that incompleteness won't really limit the precision of my approximation. I say that we build our world from simple pieces, then into larger modules, and it's Legos all the way up. Start with the brain, and note that we change its structure as we learn.
