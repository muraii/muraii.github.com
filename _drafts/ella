Ella died five years ago.  We buried her, visited her grave a couple of times, and then stopped.  We--maybe I--had come to the conclusion that she was gone, was not neatly tucked away in a coffin in a cemetery, and so visiting her grave was all about us, or me.  She left, she died, she ended; everything else was ceremony and custom.

I don't know if it was my divorce, Ella's death, or something else, but soon thereafter I found it increasingly difficult to take things too seriously, to see any clear justification for my assumptions.  Of course, the little things never lost importance--these are things tied to my personhood, to my definition of self, even if they are so against my better judgement.  And that's kind of the point: once the large sweeping dramas of my presence, my experience, or my life begins to dissolve in a solution of scrutiny, there is no foundation on which to build moral frameworks, no pedestal on which to place what's sacred.  When layers of artificial machination lose their charm, all you're left with is what you _want_.
