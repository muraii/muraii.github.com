A decade or so ago I recall having been full of inspiration. Full of ideas is things to try and happy to ruminate on them. I trawled the blog-happy web and rejoiced to see what people were doing. I found great pleasure in catching up with an increasingly specific group of writers and designers and artists. I noticed the social connections between them represented across blog rolls and the like. Across bespoke communities like [DESIGN COMMUNITY].

Because it was not yet as easy to distribute a digital presence across the web as it is today, these _ad hoc_ and bespoke communities felt tight-knit, maybe even warm. Even though I was rarely a direct participant I did my thing adjacent and sometimes parallel to their things. I learned, I tried, I was probably a little creepy. And this siphoning of helpful energy helped me through some rough times.

Today it's harder to find this experience. Harder to find an ephemeral party to watch, the edges of which to skirt and, with some new-found maturity and restraint, sidle into. Even though I have a larger collection of online friends and acquaintances I still don't have quite the same thing.

That yesterday crew is still around after a fashion but some have gone dark or dusk, and because it's much easier to fling things around the connected world it's easier to avoid the collectivism.
