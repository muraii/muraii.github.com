Why all the hate for open-world games that fill your time and attention with fetch quests and poorly written dialog? Seems we could easily reduce our daily lives to lots of fetch quests. Why is it your boss needs you to go get stuff she's quite capable of getting? Aren't you on a fetch quest when you shop for groceries, or Christmas, or games? Isn't most of the interaction you have with people inane and perfunctory?

How different, then, is the Bethesda model from reality?
