I read a [puzzle] (http://richardwiseman.wordpress.com/2012/01/20/its-the-friday-puzzle-144/) on Richard Wiseman's blog. He claimed that the word "footstool" is a palindrome, and wanted readers to assess in what way he was correct. I thought for possibly one second, then clicked the links to see what others had said. I read one comment then retreated from them. That comment said: "Got it. 1 min."

For the remaining time I worked on the puzzle, that comment was more prominent than the puzzle itself. My excercise became more about competing, or even more fundamentally, about measuring my worth against an arbitrary elapsed time, than curiosity in the puzzle itself.

This highlights an issue with which I have difficulty: weighing the importance of a result more heavily than the importance of work toward the result. This is the same in mathematics.
