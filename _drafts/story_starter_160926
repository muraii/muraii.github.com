"I'd inch away a bit," I said. Still quiet, still standing there, unmoved. Not an untenable position I guess. It's a thing people do, for whatever reasons, and there are few if any materialized drawbacks to it.

I clear my throat. I'm stalling. What the hell do I know? "I guess that's a 'no'. Alright, here goes."

I start winding the arm. It's cold, milled from a solid block of iron, capped with a cheap plastic handle that doesn't provide much grip. Especially with the sweat. I grip more tightly and lean into it a little and hear the gears begrudging motion. The cable goes taut, silently, which surprises me. I expected a twang or something. The grip spins on the iron arm. I bear down and grunt the effort.

I hear the rain for the first time, and then my memory fades into place and I realilze it's been pouring for a bit. The floor's wet but  my feet aren't slipping, even with a sheen of oil lifted by the rain water. He's still standing there, not looking at me or the Granger, or the rain, or his arms outstretched.
