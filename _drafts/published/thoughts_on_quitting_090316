- The prospect of halting study makes every other thing I'm going harder.

- I can't fucking believe I'm going to quit.  Again.

- Yeah, "temporarily."  Well, temporarily is predicated on the presumption that conditions may change sufficiently to allow me to go back.  Let's see:
   - still married
   - still have kids
   - still have mortgage
   - still have cars
   - still have bills
   - still have job
   - What the fuck is going to change?

- Why am I saw caught up in this, though?  If nothing matters, why does this matter so much?  Yeah, the same old reasons:
   - the higher probability of finding something to generate income that doesn't suck
   - the higher probability of following through on particular trajectories of study with the presence of deadlines
   - the higher probability of following through on particular trajectories of study with the availability of a community of like-minded students

- Is this worth the expense of time spent on other things, though, like reading, philosophy, writing, observing, parenting?
   - I wish it weren't a competition of focus, but it is

- Why should it be so hard, though?  I guess, well, there's a certain logical aspect, a systematic sorting of planned action upon the completion of a prioritization; but there's the tough part: the prioritization.  Once that's done, the rest is easy.  Essentially like the aphorism that says once you figure out what's right, it's actually pretty easy to do.

- Do I hang the dressing of my personhood on this thing, this math deal, like I'm hiding from the possibility of doing or being someone else?  Why should it distress me this much?  Rather, why *does* it distress me this much (a separate question from why it should or shouldn't)?
   - Part of the answer is the frustration that I KNOW I will want to, will crave to, finish, and this only puts this long history's end further into the future.  Further into the future, further from the likelihood that I'll maintain/develop a facility to make it easier.  Starting over again and again only makes the entire venture that much less efficient, that much harder to have done overall.
   - I hope that's the most of it, but there's a breaking of my definition of myself at the core somewhere here, that's putting me in such a funk.  This funk is not logical, it's not efficient, it's not working for me, it's not conducive to getting shit ready to move on.
