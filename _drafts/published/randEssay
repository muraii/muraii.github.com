<h3>Or: My Attempt to Win Money with Words Goes Astray</h3>
<p><em>I wrote this in the fall in an effort to earn/win cash for school.  Not sure if there's only one entry per person, like, ever, but I wouldn't send the same essay twice anyway.  Therefore, I'm free to publish it here, for what it's worth.</em></p>

<p>So far as the brightest among us can tell, the universe has at its core a rule that something cannot arise without a source.  There is no effect without a beckoning cause.  Energy results from a translation of matter, and matter from a translation of energy.</p>

<p>There is, however, a thematic exception to this rule.  Among the stars exist those great consumers of matter and energy, from which not even light can escape, black holes.  These structures result from the collapse of stars no longer able to sustain their brilliance.  The most prolific terrestrial cousin of the black hole is cancer, a cell which consumes other, healthy cells for the sole purpose of producing only more cancerous cells.</p>
