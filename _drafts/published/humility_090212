<h3>And Self-deprecation</h3>

<p>Don't bother mimicking humility through self-deprecation.  I've done this, someone reading this has done this, and we understand why it doesn't work: self-deprecation is a valuation independent of the quality of your work, "work" here meaning whatever your significant output might be.</p>

<p>Valuation depends on assessment of quality, intrinsic to work.  Self-deprecation only prostrates your efforts, confusing pity with acknowledgement.  It's a waste of your time and energy.  If you're that concerned, spend that time and energy on the endeavor instead.</p>
