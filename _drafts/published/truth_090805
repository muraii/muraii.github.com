"Why is telling the truth so important?" she asked.  I thought for a moment.  I thought about a lot of things, and needed to sort through them.  As usual, I did this aloud.  "I think it comes down to power, to a sense of control," I said.  And I think it does; but there's a bit more to telling the truth.

- definition of "truth"
- forms of "truth," e.g., "qualified knowledge" vs. "qualified knowledge"
- "honesty" doesn't imply "telling the truth," unless truth is subjective, in which case what's the point?
