<p>The University of Oxford has apparently taken &#163;2M toward answering <a href = "http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article3393198.ece">"Why do we believe in God?"</a>  From the Times article:
<blockquote>They will not attempt to solve the question of whether God exists but they will examine evidence to try to prove whether belief in God conferred an evolutionary advantage to mankind. They will also consider the possibility that faith developed as a byproduct of other human characteristics, such as sociability.</blockquote></p>
<p>I found this in <a href="http://academy.galilean-library.org/showthread.php?t=6693">a discussion about the study in the Galilean Library</a>, which is a wonderful resource for thoughtful, and almost more importantly, civil discussion across the philosophical spectrum.  I added a (typically long-winded) point of consideration, summarized by saying that, as much as "God" might just be a label for the collection of "all things we think we don't know, or which are currently ineffable and beyond our scrutiny," then any such study, however expensive, really aims to investigate just one in a class of cultural metaphors, models, for things we want to understand.</p>
