*These* words mean things. Words are the units of the calculus that let my brain calculate something in yours. My brain is the domain of this function; its image is in your brain. As usual, we seek the extreme because it provides a better grip. Either sticks and stones but not words have power, or words reign supreme over our agency. Rather, words have power unless they, like Schr&ouml;dinger's cat, are never seen; but we have the dials and levers to modulate that power. If you prefer to say that words are powerless, then it would do us all well for you to be a mute. If you hold that words are omnipotent, well, you get te same advice. Otherwise, a little mindfulness goes a long way.
