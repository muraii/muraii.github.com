		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have had some kind of website for approaching ten years, mostly on but once or twice off.  Despite my expectations to the contrary, I never applied much editorial direction to my writing, which as often as not led me to waste any reader's time with yet more blathering on some controversial topic of the day.  There is a place for that; as of now, <em>this</em> is not <a href="http://erectlocution.com/boxing/">that place</a>.  For the more ephemeral reflections, I use the one-two of <a href="http://twitter.com/muraii" title="I'm on the Twitter!">Twitter</a> and, less frequently (for now), <a href="http://erectlocution.tumblr.com" title="I'm on the Tumblr!">Tumblr</a></p>

<p>I am a <a href="http://www.linux.org">Linux</a> user.  I appreciate what <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> rolls out, but I'm much more comfortable in a pretty bare <a href="http://www.slackware.com">Slackware</a> setup.  For most of my tenure as a Slackware user, I used <a href="http://icculus.org/openbox/index.php/Main_Page">Openbox</a> as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager">window manager</a>, but after purchasing my first new computer in a decade, I decided to let <a href="http://www.kde.org">KDE</a> tempt me.  I have returned to Openbox.</p>

<p>I won't say I "enjoy photography."  That's such a castrated statement.  I have a camera&mdash;a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pentax_products">Pentax</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pentax_products#P_Series">P3</a>&mdash;and I've started keeping it closer and loaded with film.  I recently read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bryan-Peterson/e/B000APQPTU/ref=ep_sprkl_at_B000APQPTU?pf_rd_p=482609291&pf_rd_s=auto-sparkle&pf_rd_t=301&pf_rd_i=bryan%20peterson&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=0J8VWVK0VGC4AZCA6SFN">Bryan Peterson</a>'s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Exposure-Bryan-Peterson/dp/B0028CMJ84/ref=sr_1_33?ie=UTF8&qid=1248544256&sr=8-33">Understanding Exposure</em></a>, the 1990 edition, and as much as it covers fundamentals, it does so in the engaging fashion of learning something slowly and patiently.  My camera is a 35mm film camera, and has few automatic functions.  Certainly, aperture priority is the most useful of them, but I've shot less than a handful of frames on that setting.  I'm learning, so the less automation the better.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is why we still delight in dirty jokes; we all know their subtext, and can often predict their punchlines.  We need these contexts, these distorting frames of awareness, to make sense of the world.  We know we won't achieve parity of understanding and reality; our hypotheses will always need refinement.  We accept that all our knowledge is approximation, and <em>need</em> it to be so.</p>

<p>This is why porn and prostitution and lying and theft remain fixtures in our cultures.  It's no accident that congregations of people will invariably sort themselves into a pecking order.  Perfection, like power, carries obligatory responsibility, and most people prefer to outsource their authority to people more interested in wielding it.  Whatever impedes perfection&mdash;like crime&mdash;protects us from the great responsibility that comes with great power.</p>]]></content:encoded>
		<excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Shadow knows; and you don't want to.  Conspicuous monsters aren't monsters.  They're neighbors, however temporary.  Monsters are guerilla, unseen, opportunistic.  They stay shrouded in potential.  Where Lorentz had it for relativistic contraction based on inertial frames, these things enjoy a distortion wrought from awareness frames.</p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><blockquote>I'm rather depressed these days. It's been years since anything I've done has turned out successfully -- with a few rare exceptions -- and I'm falling into the thing which afflicted you a couple of years ago -- a failure of the will, shall we say. My ambitions seem far beyond my talents, and light-years beyond the vicissitudes of my character, and I think of this enormous novel I'm now starting, which could well take ten years, and if done properly, it must be unpublishable except in green-backed French "dirty" editions, and I'll be middle-aged when it's done, and somehow I just don't believe in myself the way I used to, and indeed, worst of all, it doesn't even seem terribly important. I'm beginning to have the tolerance of the defeated -- people I would have despised a few years ago now seem bearable -- after all, I say to myself, I haven't done very well with all the luck I had, and perhaps I do wrong to judge them.</blockquote>
<cite>Norman Mailer (via <a href="http://kottke.org">kottke</a>)</cite></p>

<p>I'll avoid the obvious bemoaning by asking your take on this thing we call "depression."  I question why we've firmly fixed "depression" among the constellations of malady.  I'm a little torn between two angles:
<ul>
<li>Is the great taxonomic engine that is science staking out real afflictions of the mind, helping people understand they don't suffer alone, that there may be ways to mitigate their pain?</li>
<li>Alternately, is "depression" shorthand for "I see it, now: this whole enterprise of living is absurd, so I can't bring myself to care about it"?</li>
</ul></p>

<p>As much as I might believe anything, I believe my "mind" is an emergent property of a messy tangle of neurons and its interactions with the rest of my body and environment.  No fault in thinking that fixing a mind might start with adjusting its environment, via psychotropics or diet or exercise, etc.  However, that presupposes that a particular mindset or behavior is aberrant, that its generative mind is ailing.  If in fact a particular conclusion defies widely held ideas, and we diagnose its resultant stress as "disease," we do so by fiat.  None of us knows, none of us subscribes to the Universe's secret newsletter, <em>You: The Unabridged Story of What You Need and How to Get It</em>.</p>

<p>To put it another way is to resort to clich&eacute;: What if the mad are running the asylum; and how can we even know?</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I sweat a little in the intimidating glare of a blank canvas of any material, e.g., canvas, paper, LCD, blackboard.  Each new stroke, each new keypress, seems only to gather me closer to the most imminent and unavoidable failure.  I would not have honestly written that in 1989, when I claimed I would write my own exhaustive dictionary of the universe.  Somewhere in the interim, I came to join this fear as a daily companion.  Think <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084237/">The Last Unicorn</a></em>, who&mdash;upon learning of regret&mdash;slowly loses her magic.  Except my case might be so common as to be archetypical.</p>

<p>I understand the practical need for a division of things into piles labeled "right" and "wrong," especially if they don't include moral things; that's quite the nasty bog there, and I'll (continue to) come back to it sometime soon.  But think back to your grade-school days, to those waking hours when The Possible World was opened to you only by traversing The World of Correct Answers.  While your teachers hopefully taught you of gerunds and multiplication tables and sea anemones and General Robert E. Lee, what you learned most of all was how to fail.  Long after you've forgotten that 14 x 14 = 196, you remember how little you enjoyed school.  You remember feeling that something wasn't quite right, that you didn't fit.  You remember feeling that you were missing something, some special handbook, a leathery tome of gilt-edged pages with all the answers to both odd- <em>and</em> even-numbered problems, and an entire chapter dedicated to the best mnemonic rhymes.</p>

<p>Maybe you did quite well in school, actually; more's the pity.  That may only mean that you embraced the dichotomy, and that may only mean you're going to fall harder when it fails to provide footing.  The world is just as easily divided into "right" and "wrong" as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip">MoÃ«bius strip</a> is divided into "top" and "bottom": it kind of works, until you look a little closer.</p>

<p>We were ending when we should have been beginning.  Maybe it's inevitable that our pedagogy mirrors Darwinian ruthlessness, given that that's our behavioral role model; and professional teachers merely parrot the species' generalized expectations, so it's not at their feet that I lay this.  Our great^<em>n</em>-grandparents and their ancestors laid the gravel, the cobblestones, and the pavement on which we tread, and laid it with the best of intentions.  It's still a road to hell; anecdotally, I feel that a world population of more than six billion ever-more-densely-distributed humans ensures that, though the roads are necessarily wider, we're even more likely to stay on them than to walk in the grass with bare feet.  Like the early universe, in which symmetries broke and things started clumping together and the fundamental forces split and spent the next 20 billion years arguing for custody.</p>

<p>This isn't a story about elementary school, though, and it's not about population control.  It's a story about my intimate friendship with Fear, and how it's ruined my friendship with Creativity; Creativity's pretty laid back, requiring but one thing of her closest pals: bravery.  The bravery to feel stupid and keep coming back, to stop trying what works and try something else, to be wrong in the face of an easier rightness.  We're distant friends anymore, though I try to call when I can.</p>

<p>Thing is, Fear, quite the diligent acquaintance, got me smoking and now borrows all my cigarettes.  It used to be about the music, man, but that's over and we don't even have any groupies.  Or a band.  Or a smoking habit.  Or any substantive writing or sketchworks or mathematical intuitions from the past 15 years.</p>

<p>I called Creativity yesterday and left a message.  I rambled for a while, nervously, a little too plaintively, but she always liked that about me anyway.  Afterwards, I equivocated for twenty minutes on which of two grey T-shirts to wear.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I understand this.  Trying to consider every configuration of choices yields the same sort of error your calculator returns when you divide anything by zero.  There are too many.</p>

<p>Rather than fret over this <a href="http://erectlocution.com/boxing/2005/12/20/on-that-part-of-your-terra-cotta-boilerplate-that-always-manages-to-eat-away-at-whatever-you-call-a-nervous-humdrummery/">maddening</a> feat, it's simpler to look at the moment.  <em>What do I need right now?</em> we ask.  <em>What can I do today?  I don't care where I'm going in a year, or five years, or for the rest of my life; where do I want to be tomorrow, or maybe even this weekend?</em>  This scope maps more cleanly to our faculties; like predicting weather some five years in the future, predicting what will be right for me next year or the year after relies on understanding too many variables.  I won't be a long-range climatologist; I'll just be a weather man.  <em>Is it raining today, and if so, do I need to close the windows?  Is it raining tomorrow, and if so, will I need to take an umbrella?</em></p>

<p>I get it, really.  Many people, myself included, fumed over the Teri Schiavo case.  While politicians, preachers, and pundits argued from their comfortable rhetoric, Ms. Schiavo lay in a state with which none of us were prepared to truly empathize, but for its possibly great discomfort, sympathized.  The idealist would stubbornly hold out on conclusion until he had considered all angles, had worked out all the moral calculus; those who fumed skewed toward the pragmatic, honoring the quality of her life before honoring the muddled precepts of any <em>culture</em> of life.</p>

<p>While sitting here, in Fountain Square, typing this, a man approached with a pitiable but unsurprising expression, asking for spare change.  I have spare change in my pocket, and just as much  as before I told him I had none.  After the fact, I am pondering the rightness of my lie, of my presumption that this man was attempting to take advantage of my sympathy.  I'm pondering the rightness of refusing to offer a minimal amount of money even <em>if</em> he misrepresented himself.  Here, I acted pragmatically, eyeing the moment's result rather than its implications about my moral fiber, or some objective moral cloth into which I might weave myself.  Whose hoax was worse?</p>

<p>It's all a hoax.</p>

<h3>Falling Down</h3>

<p>The focus on pragmatism versus idealism is not so much a focus on whether or not to worry about the specificity and completeness of a moral consideration, as much as it is a question of how precisely such a system is to be applied.  Imagine yourself in the woods, with thunderous clouds rolling in from the north.  You have approximately 20 minutes to find or build shelter.  A fantastic idealist may attempt to take a survey of the land, of its drainage, of the types and structural integrity of various existing materials, and upon finding a suitable site, would hope to create an engineering diagram of materials, construction methods, angles and forces, and do all this before starting to build.  That is, he or she would do most of this wet.  A fantastic pragmatist would find a tree with some branches, something to lean against the tree, and wait for the storm to pass, mostly dry.  This pragmatist would not build something good, but something good enough.</p>

<p>Neither the idealist nor the pragmatist is more or less bound by the natural laws of the universe, though.  It's not as if the pragmatist considers a coarser kind of gravity, but rather considers a coarser <em>approximation</em> of the same gravity with which the idealist must work.  Pragmatism versus idealism is not a dichotomy of fundamental structures on which they hang their decisions; it is a dichotomy of the approximation of a shared, immutable structure.</p>

<p>The moral pragmatist, then, is no less accountable for measures of rightness than is the moral idealist.  No matter how approximately we consider our decisions, the reference point of their rightness doesn't change.  So, no matter how idealistic you are, you still have to wrestle with the issue of the authority, the source, of your rightness.  Is there something objective that acts as our standard?  Are we each left to define our rightness?  Are we, instead, to avoid "rightness" as a matter of course, and just accept that morality is a currency with which we pay and are paid respect within a society?  Is "right" a function of the exchange rate of our decisions in the moral marketplace?</p>

<p>Now a woman has approached me, as I sit in Fountain Square, and asked if I knew anyone who needed in-home babysitting.  Despite her obvious desparation (approaching strangers on a city square about watching their children, in their home, isn't well-reasoned), I changed my approach.  "Well, our children attend a daycare that provides some educational activities.  Everyone else I know uses something like that.  I can't think of anyone who's looking for in-home daycare."  This is all true, and that truth is independent from the fact that I wouldn't let a strange passerby in my home to watch my children.  Is this more right?  I don't know.  Is it a little more idealistic?  Yes.  Is it pragmatic?  Yes.  Its rightness, though, is invariant in either case.</p>

<p>Don't think you can, through a focus on expediency, escape the need to consider the sources and implications of your actions.  It's a hoax.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Time and cerebral resources we hope to apply to something else, something of more immediate resolve.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, a year; maybe more.  I wrote an essay in the in an effort to earn/win cash for school.  Alas, my piece was dumped with the rest of the slush pile, not quite cutting the muster.  In the two years since, I've encountered almost unanimously antipathy for Rand's novel, of which more later.  Here, though, the essay, mostly untouched.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So far as the brightest among us can tell, the universe has at its core a rule that something cannot arise without a source.  There is no effect without a beckoning cause.  Energy results from a translation of matter, and matter from a translation of energy.</p>

<p>There is, however, a thematic exception to this rule.  Among the stars exist those great consumers of matter and energy, from which not even light can escape, black holes.  These structures result from the collapse of stars no longer able to sustain their brilliance.  The most prolific terrestrial cousin of the black hole is cancer, a cell which consumes other, healthy cells for the sole purpose of producing only more cancerous cells.</p><!--more-->

<p>Self-sustaining organizations, either of stardust, DNA, or even of interested persons, must take as a primary goal continued production.  Stars must keep fusing hydrogen to make helium, and helium to make lithium, and so on.  Organic cells must continue to produce energy, sugars, proteins, and all the other building blocks of life.  So must the public and private institutions of humanity continue to produce the goods and services other public and private institutions require toward shared sustenance.</p>

<p>Early in <em>Atlas Shrugged</em>, we find the slow but steady proliferation of a cancerous ideal: The needs of a man define his worth.  At some point prior to Eddie's opening contemplations, one mind after another has given over its energies not to positivity, but the negation of apathy.  Like bees to a honeypot, holders of public and private office have swarmed to the temptation that they need only provide compelling evidence of a lacking capacity to produce in order to maintain their various business interests.</p>

<p>One of Rand's most influential villains speaks more directly to the point than he realizes.

<blockquote>'My purpose,' said Orren Boyle, 'is the preservation of a free economy.  It's generally conceded that free economy is now on trial.'

[Boyle] had started out with a hundred thousand dollars of his own and a two-hundred-million dollar loan from the government.  Now he headed an enormous concern which had swallowed many smaller companies.  This proved, he liked to say, that individual ability still had a chance to succeed in the world.</blockquote></p>

<p>What Boyle and his cronies embrace is a glaring logical fallacy: any effort which merely consumes can't but inevitably destroy all sources of sustenance.  Boyle had succeeded through only as much "individual ability" as was required to procure the alms of treasurers.  Black holes merely consume, and produce no useful byproduct; cancer consumes and produces only more cancer; and beggars can hope for naught but the depletion of the industrious folks who might give a hand-out.  The cronies' rhetoric bears out this confusion: "'After all,'" states Boyle, "'private property is a trusteeship held for the benefit of society as a whole.'"  James Taggart responds with a smile that "seemed to say that something in his words was an answer to something in the words of Boyle," and then, "'The liquor they serve here is swill....  Since I hold the purse strings, I expect to get my money's worth and at my pleasure."</p>

<p>Taggart, Boyle, the Friends of Global Progress, and all the other agents of industry's eventual collapse conflate sympathy for need with appreciation for production.  Achievement is necessarily, absolutely postivistic, resulting in something new made from something old.  They fail to understand that achievement cannot be carved out by acts of negation, cannot be formed by destroying the new to return novelty to the old.  There are more ways than one to skin a cat, but none are much good without a cat to begin with.</p>

<p>In the midst of nervous shuffling and aims of nationalization and protectionist legislation, Ellis Wyatt and Dan Conway conspire to make profits.
<blockquote>[A] train of tank cars carrying oil went hurtling down an embankment and into a blazing junk pile. . . .  Ellis Wyatt did not wait for the court to decide whether the accident was an act of God, as James Taggart claimed.  He transferred the shipping of his oil to the Phoenix-Durango, an obscure railroad which was 'small and struggling, but,' critically, 'struggling well.'  To struggle well is to see a field of negation as nothing but a frontier for positive effort, for creation, and not a source of need.  The needy bemoan a bushel of lemons when they wanted cake; those struggling well make lemonade.</blockquote></p>

<p>The consortium of lazy ignorance wastes no time passing the Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule, which "provided that the members of the National Alliance of Railroads were forbidden to engage in practices defined as 'destructive competition'."  The only practitioners of destructive competition, however, are the very parties who passed the Rule, embroiled as they are in a race for the meekest assets and the greatest relative need.  "'Nine months from now,'" James Taggart boasts to his sister, "'there's not going to be any Phoenix-Durango Railroad in Colorado!", as if the absence of competition would render unnecessary the maintenance of a railway to transport oil out of the state.</p>

<p>It's this sort of self-defeat nested within selfishness that creeps through the rest of the country, tarnishing and then reducing to rust and scraps every means of industry and production.  More importantly, of course, is the gutting of the will of men and women.  When eventually all the great thinkers and their corporations who had fueled the nation's, the world's, progress and development succumb to the secretive idyll of Midas' valley, leaving the rest of the world to embrace its negation, we find Hank Rearden and Dagny Taggart faced with the greatest casualty of all: The abandonment of the will to succeed itself.  One by one, the Ellis Wyatts and Ken Danaggers face this greatest of their fears, and realize that it is only through this abandonment of the will to succeed that they can find the will again.  Even its greatest stalwarts must look upon their mills, bridges, and railways and realize that, like the carcasses of loved ones, all that remains must be let go.</p>

<p>Our lives are but intersections of cyclic adventures, a hopeful meandering through the effects of our causes.  Each of us has come from the dust of stars, and each of us will make our way back.  The destruction of the Phoenix-Durango was the death knell of the motor of the world; and it was made possible only by a profuse worship of negation, the worship of zero.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Cognition Ignition</h3>

<p>I see people as systems with two primary sets of components:
<ol>
<li>earnest motive power</li>
<li>instruction sets</li>
</ol>
If you've ever tried to write a computer program, then you'll remember how horrible your first five attempts met with your intent.  The computer executed your code as precisely as it was written; you just didn't code worth a damn.  So it is with people:  your actions begin as an earnestness, a motivation to do <em>something</em>, whatever that is; and you follow a set of rules, an instruction set, applying the energy of that earnest motive power.</p>

<p>I can't imagine a way that people truly act outside their earnest drive.  You can't fake motivation.  However, by virtue of your lazy amassing of disorganized rules, you can

<ol>
<li>render useless any hope of understanding your drive</li>
<li>apply your motivation sloppily and with unforeseen effects</li>
<li>dupe yourself into thinking you're following the One True Instruction Set when such doesn't exist</li>
<li>abstract yourself from well-suited aspirations</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>To varying degrees, assholes evade these pitfalls.  Now, there are the misguided assholes, who don't realize it's not really the way for them; you may even be one of them.  Odds are, though, you're not a real asshole; you take the shit you're given, you say "Please" and "Thank you" even when you're not sure you need bother.  And you can't remember the last time you really pissed someone off.  Really, that's a skillset you need to develop; it's not until you've pissed someone off that they're really invested anyway.</p>

<h3>It's Time</h3>

<p>So, close your browser, stop reading CNN updates about protests against warm milk, get up, and go tell Ted to stop bragging about his gastrointestinal health.  Tell him that no matter how regular he is, he's still full of shit and couldn't hack it in the real world outside his gym-and-latte set.  There are millions of Teds, so you're not really wasting a valuable commodity by enraging him to impotent silence.</p>]]></content:encoded>
		<excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p>God loves assholes.  Seriously.  Any god worth frothing about for gets a stiffy when they see people acting on their prerogatives.  Any god worth painstakingly describing in illuminated text TiVOs premeditated murderers on the street, pacifists in jail, and that crazy man at the end of your street who wants to sell you a brand new hottub that's still in the wrapper and worth all of $2,500 only he's not asking that much he just needs to get rid of it to help Brian liquidate since he's losing his house.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've seen, from atop a mountain, a storm pass slowly, deliberately over a valley below.  I've seen storms dutifully cleanse a land scarred by industry.  I've seen storms rip trees from the ground and casually discard them in the path of industry.  I've seen storms compel the tide to crash ashore, pushing salty foam through 15 feet of porous rock, spouting from the top like from a craggy, volcanic whale.</p>

<p>Finally, I made the acquaintance of a storm, of its full breadth.  I watched its miles-long sinew contract among a sunset's lazy sky.  The tiring sun cast light through a sheet of rain, a translucent glowing dressing screen for its modest disrobing.</p>

<p>I hadn't seen a good storm in a long time.  I imagine some mythic land where storms gather and rampage and mingle and merge, &#252;berstorms.  These are our giants; I missed them, and I miss them again.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
Last week, Robert Bingaman articulated some thoughts about <a href = "http://www.robertjosiah.com/journal/403/erring-on-the-side-of-life" title = "Erring on the Side of Life">the culture of life</a> as evinced in some current events.  This set off a <a href = "http://www.robertjosiah.com/journal/403/#c000861" title = "Discussion on: Erring on the Side of Life">discussion</a>, primarily (of interest to me, anyway) between <a href = "http://www.robertjosiah.com/journal/403/#c000863" title = "My first comment">me</a> and <a href="http://www.robertjosiah.com/journal/403/#c000864" title = "Robert's first response">Robert</a>, which, until now, ended with Robert stating the following:

<blockquote>
&#147;And if it's an illusion, your way of life that is, why don't you do the most meaningful thing possible and kill yourself (with the optional hope that you'd be waking up)?&#148;
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
On the face of it, especially out of context, this appears to be the utterance of some wretchedly deluded, dogmatic, heartless man.  It is, in fact, one of the most complimentary things anyone has ever said to me.  There, between the words, holding them together as a fine tapestry, is the subtle and rare respect for others one finds in a mind willing to hold forth consistently and completely from his philosophy.  Robert doesn't blunt his point with a euphemizing retreat.  He simply follows the development of his point of view within the thread to its logical conclusion.  It's in his doing so, without feeling the need to pull on the reins to avoid offense, that tells me he respects me and the other readers enough to speak maturely and squarely on the point.
</p>

<p>
There was some retribution regarding the bluntness, to which Robert replied evenly and respectfully, as anyone who's read for even a short time (like me) should expect.  The retribution is sort of understandable: even as eloquent and, more importantly, well-articulated as Robert is, text can quite often skew connotation through the absence of connotative tools to which we're accustomed, such as tone of voice and body language.  Still, there wasn't anything patently offensive in the discussion on the part of any participants.
</p>

<p>
The whole thing comes at a serendipitous moment for me.  I am in a foreign place, with little but my internal gyroscope to guide me, and all about me are voices real and imagined whose cacophony confuses.  Over the last few months, I've spent no small amount of time plumbing the depths of my and my fianc&#233;e's perspectives on religion and spirituality; and I've been spending more time watching and listening to messages of faith where I can find them.  Honestly, quite a lot has been from the perspective of a nonbeliever looking for specific examples as support of my position on spirituality and, moreso, religion.  In all fairness, a good bit of the most easily accessible religious and spiritual media is shamefully asinine, which does religious faith a disservice and, I hope, is not necessarily representative.  So, I haven't found anything that but through this absurdity supports my prejudice.  I'll keep looking.  Discussions such as the one continued below offer much more to chew on, and with a hopefully broader and deeper palette of flavor.
</p>

<p>
Herewith, my response.  Comments are open.
</p>

<img class = "rule" src = "http://www.bjsings.com/images/rule.png" alt = "--" width = "400" />

<p>
The supposition that the soundest choice afforded me, afflicted as I am with the absence of a larger moral framework from which I draw my own, is death, is interesting, but little more.  Your claim seems to be that life is a deterministic result of this moral structure, a structure built by larger design.  Without such a structure informing life, the life is inherently without purpose, according to this, and, purpose apparently the foundation for life, it is aberrant, absurd to use your word, and unfit for continuation.  I see two problems with your general application.
</p>

<p>
First, I challenge the presumption that life itself is dependent upon a purpose for it.  I see no evidence to suggest that there exists any intrinsic need within the universe for life, any more than there is a need for gravity, and so there is no purpose served by either.  Certainly it might be contended that life, like gravity, is a useful result of the perturbations of forces and particles over billions of years, temporal and light, though gravity seems far more useful.  At the very least, the terrestrial environment is likely quite different than it would be had not humanity achieved its historic influence.  However, whatever this utility might be it is only utility in the context of open-ended processes, with no more value in one or the other possible consequence.  If humanity eventually affects some noticeable presence and deformation of some statistically significant volume of the Milky Way galaxy, it would be no more or less beneficial a result than if the species had become extinct.  Either is simply a potentiality unfettered by design or intelligent direction.  In the absence of life or gravity, the universe would simply be built differently to one degree or another.
</p>

<p>
Second, there is an implicit contention that the morality thought to result as an extension of a larger, purposeful framework (for fun, I'll coin &#147;exomorality&#148;) exists less within the domain of the personal mind than does the internally constructed morality (&#147;endomorality&#148;).  This is as ridiculous as the coined taxonomy: whatever you consider the source of your morality, it is <em>you</em> parsing the legitimate components of such from the illegitimate.  Each of us is as much the puppet of our preconceptions as the other.  That you attribute the quality and texture of your conception of right and wrong to some higher, guiding authority doesn't make it any more objectively well-built than mine.  That you think so is simply a result of your conception of right and wrong, and so is circular.
</p>

<p>
Also, it's worth clarifying that I didn't mean to establish the nonbeliever's moral code as wholly reflexive, as being constructed in a vacuum.  Rather, I see it as constructed from observations of the world through the amalgam filter of our cultures.  While not nearly as rigorous, it's not unlike the development of theory through application of the scientific method.  I would love to say I've developed this hypothesis further, but I haven't, which is one reason I value this conversation as much as I do.  What makes sense upon reflection is that morality is, as life and gravity are, emergent and nondeterministic.  There is a larger context from which we gather our morality, but I think that context itself is emergent, undesigned, and variable: human society.  I don't mean the same &#147;society&#148; which all manner of miscreant blames for his or her having grown up in a ghetto or somesuch and, inevitably, for having been forced to commit crimes to live, though, of course, that society is at least a subset of the one to which I refer.  I mean society as the summation of all networks of persons past and present, and its quite complicated topology.
</p>

<p>
Upon this reflection, morality seems a force propagated along that network, derived from a fundamental prerequisite of life, the drive to survive, taken at a species level.  It is, of course, as with all emergent systems (or, more generally, most logical systems of any sophistication), fairly complex, and imperfect.  Largely disconnected populations can, and have, developed starkly different schemas of right and wrong, and it is with great difficulty at least that any one claims definitively to have the most righteous.  If this is true, then there is no objective set of invariable morals, and I find no reason to believe such exists.
</p>

<p>
Ultimately, we seem to disagree on the answer to a generating question: what is life?  You could likely recite more quickly and completely the biological perspective, which I won't call a <em>definition</em> since there is some contention in the details; but I would more readily consider it a full explanation than you.  Where two &#147;nonbelievers&#148; might quibble over whether or not to consider a virus alive, they don't consider among the criteria a belief on the part of the virus in &#147;Reason&#150;by way of design&#148;.  Even the fact that you and I each counts as an element in morality something beyond the <em>person</em> doesn't bridge that gap, because my categorization allows for a single human to fully constitute both the domain and the range of morality, whereas you would probably still believe in a relationship between that person and an (the) extrahuman <em>designer</em>.
</p>

<p>
So, not necessarily unfortunately, I must fall back on an inconclusive conclusion, and respectfully <a href = "http://boxingjewels.blogspot.com/2005/03/god-cant-be-dead.html" title = "God Can't Be Dead">agree to disagree with you</a>.  I will take that inconclusivity any day over dogmatic and illusory completeness.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ella died five years ago.  We buried her, visited her grave a couple of times, and then stopped.  We--maybe I--had come to the conclusion that she was gone, was not neatly tucked away in a coffin in a cemetery, and so visiting her grave was all about us, or me.  She left, she died, she ended; everything else was ceremony and custom.

I don't know if it was my divorce, Ella's death, or something else, but soon thereafter I found it increasingly difficult to take things too seriously, to see any clear justification for my assumptions.  Of course, the little things never lost importance--these are things tied to my personhood, to my definition of self, even if they are so against my better judgement.  And that's kind of the point: once the large sweeping dramas of my presence, my experience, or my life begins to dissolve in a solution of scrutiny, there is no foundation on which to build moral frameworks, no pedestal on which to place what's sacred.  When layers of artificial machination lose their charm, all you're left with is what you _want_.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>These</em> words mean things. Words are the units of the calculus that let my brain calculate something in yours. My brain is the domain of this function; its image is in your brain.

As usual, we seek the extreme because it provides a better grip. Either sticks and stones but not words have power, or words reign supreme over our agency. Rather, words have power unless they, like Schrödinger's cat, are never seen; but we have the dials and levers to modulate that power.

If you prefer to say that words are powerless, then it would do us all well for you to be a mute. If you hold that words are omnipotent, well, you get te same advice. Otherwise, a little mindfulness goes a long way.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not as an adult. I have earned my living, in those eras in which I did earn it, doing whatever seemed easiest, most convenient. I have never set my sights on the transmuting of an avocation into a vocation, of making a living doing--as a teacher once described--my "beautiful work."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>There are many reasons for this, some I have covered here, some I <em>will</em> cover here, some I may not comment upon publically, and some I cannot yet fathom. One of the more significant is my penchant to maintain a well-stocked pantry of defeatist justifications. I'm always ready to explain why I can't do this thing or that thing, things I earnestly want to be doing with my operative brain time. Like writing.</p>
<p>I hesitate to live like I hesitate to write: I worry that there's some perfect version of whatever I aim to say or do, and more importantly, that I'm doomed to its antithesis. I have no shortage of topics and plots whose details I'd like to pen; and I have no shortage of activities and ventures I would take great pleasure in exercising. But I come to the keyboard or the paper and pen and am suddenly lost, cannot find my way through the ideas that are receding as if lassoed by my fear; and I consider all the ways I might do great work while making a living and find every exception to that plan.</p>
<p>The way through is simple enough. There are no tricks. There is just the slow, arduous reprogramming my brain by doing things, seeing them done, and remarking that despite their imperfections they are still worth having done. "There is no win, there is no fail. There is only make." Still, it's a while before a boy can casually walk to the bed under which he suspects hides a monster. I just hope it's not much longer.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I came across the following, via <a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/08/07/16052.html" title="Jason Kottke">kottke.org</a>, and while it's not quite as concise as <a href="http://hi-and-low.typepad.com/my_weblog/2008/01/a-new-year.html">other efforts</a>, <a href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article4022091.ece?print=yes&randnum=1212475411171" title="Nassim Nicholas Taleb's top life tips">"Taleb's top life tips"</a> nevertheless makes for interesting brain fodder.  I'd care to hear which of these are particularly interesting to you.

<blockquote>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Scepticism is effortful and costly. It is better to be sceptical about matters of large consequences, and be imperfect, foolish and human in the small and the aesthetic.</li>
<li>Go to parties. You can't even start to know what you may find on the envelope of serendipity. If you suffer from agoraphobia, send colleagues.</li>
<li>It's not a good idea to take a forecast from someone wearing a tie. If possible, tease people who take themselves and their knowledge too seriously.</li>
<li>Wear your best for your execution and stand dignified. Your last recourse against randomness is how you act&mdash;if you can't control outcomes, you can control the elegance of your behaviour. You will always have the last word.</li>
<li>Don't disturb complicated systems that have been around for a very long time. We don't understand their logic. Don't pollute the planet. Leave it the way we found it, regardless of scientific "evidence".</li>
<li>Learn to fail with pride&mdash;and do so fast and cleanly. Maximise trial and error&mdash;by mastering the error part.</li>
<li>Avoid losers. If you hear someone use the words "impossible", "never", "too difficult" too often, drop him or her from your social network. Never take "no" for an answer (conversely, take most "yeses" as "most probably").</li>
<li>Don't read newspapers for the news (just for the gossip and, of course, profiles of authors). The best filter to know if the news matters is if you hear it in cafes, restaurants... or (again) parties.</li>
<li>Hard work will get you a professorship or a BMW. You need both work and luck for a Booker, a Nobel or a private jet.</li>
<li>Answer e-mails from junior people before more senior ones. Junior people have further to go and tend to remember who slighted them.</li>
</ol>
</p>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>Additionally, though within a more focused scope (and from <a href="http://www.kottke.org/remainder/08/07/16059.html" title="Jason Kottke">the same source</a>), Kurt Vonnegut advises on <a href="" title="Kurt Vonnegut">how to write with style</a>.  Herewith, a full reproduction.  (I'm open to suggestions if reproducing these here, even with proper credits, breaks with good sense.)

<blockquote>
<p>In Sum:

<ol>
<li>Find a subject you care about</li>
<li>Do not ramble, though</li>
<li>Keep it simple</li>
<li>Have guts to cut</li>
<li>Sound like yourself</li>
<li>Say what you mean</li>
<li>Pity the readers</li>
</ol>
</p>
</blockquote>

I find, for some, that the first is surprisingly difficult.  I rather have a hard time choosing a subject I care <em>most</em> about; it's my utter failure at commiting to any one subject that leads to my abject frustration in making headway in any of them.</p>

<p>Mr. Kottke seems to revel in this meme.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>And while the the Carlin canon pivots on those seven words, they were only part of his larger social commentary machine.  No doubt the Richard Pryors and Steven Wrights of the world owe some small debt to George Carlin.  As social creatures who, if unwittingly, make use of their exploits, we, too, owe him that debt.  I often found his delivery a little too fond of itself, but maybe that was part of the bit.</p>

<p>However his cultural value is estimated, he seems one of the last of a dying breed, if not necessarily a dying species.  I don't get out much, but I don't recall hearing of anyone with a similar currency, in terms of popularity and stickiness, who challenges social norms as a matter of principle.  The closest might be Dave Chappelle, off the top of my head, but that's not where I keep my good stuff so I'm not sure how much you should invest in that idea.  Oprah Winfrey notwithstanding, the popular culture has changed over these decades of Carlin's popular decline, and any market research company (including mine) will tell you that it's increasingly difficult to intercept peoples' attention.  Some have called George Carlin a "<a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/06/23/carlin">hero</a>"; I'm not sure anyone can become that kind of hero in a culture that cherishes its schisms and disaffection.</p>]]></content:encoded>
		<excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carlin died in June of 2008, at the age of 71.  It's hard to estimate Carlin's value in the Western culture; his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_dirty_words">Seven Words</a> are, today, somewhat less powerful than they were in 1972, and no matter his one-time popularity, their deflation is not significantly his doing, I think.  At his height, TV love scenes still involved the "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/One-Foot-Floor-Louis-Chunovic/dp/1575001861">one foot on the floor</a>" rule, so for many the Carlin spiel was apparently quite powerful.</p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The Yin</h3>

<p>From <a href="http://whiskeyriver.blogspot.com">Whiskey</a> by way of the singular <a href="http://www.hydragenic.com">Hydragenic</a>:
<blockquote>... creativity is essentially an overwhelming presence of awareness, and may very well be mindfulness, and could be a form of meditation, or it could be more like lucid dreaming (outside of dreaming - as in, lucid wakefulness), or it could be the state attained through the creative mind, which seems to be on a whole different level of consciousness altogether.</blockquote>

Hydragenic <a href="http://www.hydragenic.com/2008/06/04/still_turning_to_face_the_strange/">responds "intuitively."</a>

<blockquote>Yes, yes, yes. And can we throw the word 'otherness' in there somehow as well? Creativity as an approaching of the divine via a process of lucid mindfulness that allows us to appreciate, however briefly and superficially, the intrinsic strangeness of everything other than oneself.</blockquote></p>

<p>Hg soaks in this for a bit, and illuminates some deeper reflection, steeped over years and an embrace of the strange.

<blockquote>We're all looking for meaning in life, one way or another. I've come to the conclusion that meaning comes from creativity. Creativity in its broadest sense: the bees in the garden gathering pollen to make honey, friends and family making relationships and babies, businesses concocting fascinating products, singers pulling together words and melodies, painters filling canvases with dreams and desires.</blockquote>

Thus, so far, we get the picture that meaning is a consequence of, and not a cause of nor reason for, our existence.  A search for meaning, then, should not be a search for some pocket of import somewhere in the aether, should not be an effort to distill some <a href="http://godplaysdice.blogspot.com/2008/02/back-of-universe.html">back-of-the-universe</a> answer to the question "What is the purpose of life?"  Rather, we have but to create our meaning, and live our meaning.</p>

<p>Where, in other hands, this sort of inspection might yield a gaudy melodrama, Hg finds empowerment, in the attribution of meaning to those who would build their own.

<blockquote><p>To discover something is to encounter its essence, which the dictionary describes as "the basic, real, and invariable nature of a thing or its significant individual feature or features". Its true identity, in other words: what makes it different to everything else. It strikes me that art - creativity - is the process of divining and defining uniqueness. It's fine to make connections between things, but ultimately those things are separate.</p>

<p>Does that sound too bleak? I see it as strength, as infinite richness. Too abstract? We all encounter art on a daily basis, in one form or another. Too solipsistic? I can't dispute that: all I am is all I am.</p></blockquote></p>

<h3>The Yang</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.jaredigital.com">Jared Christensen</a> has touched on <a href="http://www.jaredigital.com/article/232/ecosystems-of-failure">a parallel set of observations</a>.  Though mostly specific to the software industry (my own feeble gross overgeneralization of a culture, but it suffices), Jared's piece provides a subtle but explicit hook to abstraction.  And, anyway, the "software industry" is just instance of a class of social dynamic systems, which allows for a natural comparison across common points of structure.

<blockquote>Sometimes I look around at the state of software, and systems in general, and wonder if they are run by [agents of chaos (<em>my paraphrasing</em>)]. Or perhaps the chaos began by human fallibility, but now the mess is willfully maintained in order to feed this ecosystem that thrives on the system failure. Do companies actually put overly complex, mildy [<em>sic</em>] destructive products out into the market, intentionally giving rise to and continuing to feed an ecosystem of other companies that thrive on repairing the damage? Are some systems designed to be so irritating and complex that whole industries must be erected to make sense of it (*cough* taxes)? Is broken the preferred state for the makers of some products and systems we interact with every day? And does the ecosystem have the power to perpetuate the failure, supplanting the creatorâ€™s will to rectify the problems?</blockquote></p>

<p>Surely, you've heard arguments of similar logical structure applied to government, to law enforcement, to lawyers, to the profession of educators, to book publishers, and to practically innumerable other facets of our shared lives.  Each year, hundreds of high school and university departments order the <em>n</em>th edition of Larry Hackajob's monotonously-uninspiring text for &lt;<em>some class</em>&gt;, not because it's an improvement, but due to a self-propagated system of kickbacks and peer pressure designed not only to justify this subsequent edition, but to penalize the frugality of just using last year's edition.  At least Western, and most industrialized, societies require work to justify the <em>creation</em> of jobs to buoy the societies themselves.  Consider pieces of Roosevelt's New Deal, which included allocations of the federal budget explicitly for the creation of jobs, not because there was a pressing need for any of them, as much as to start the nation's long economic repair.  We might usually consider <em>work</em> to include an intrinsic necessity, but, while an indefatigably noble cause, and more, ethically necessary, these programs were artifacts.  The theme echoes through time.</p>

<h3>Unity</h3>
<p>Drawing them together, I can't help but conclude that all our efforts, all our endeavors, are not dissimilar from those Depression-era policies nor from the willful messes of agents of chaos.  If, as Hg posits, meaning is our product and not the other way 'round, then we build our own temples to chaos and fabricate our need to aspire and achieve, no matter the ambition or arena.  Assuming this, there's absolutely no wonder so many of us are lost, listless, and sometimes paralyzed by the prospect of choosing a course.</p>
<p>Once, quite without meaning to, I advised someone to embrace just such a notion.  When asked how to decide the rightness of an act or decision, I said something like, "Well, I don't know, it's hard to say; but maybe we just have to decide what we would <em>want</em> to be right, and stay as close to that as we can."</p>
<p>I care about the answer non-academically, in a real, <em>I have an assignment and it is to live and I don't want to fail</em> kind of way.  As I told Hg, though, in a comment:
<blockquote>Truth be told, I'm a little lost on this question. There's no greater sensibility to leaving the world than staying, so at the very least, an inclination to survive keeps me going. But if the most we can hope for is to revel in the possibilities of our creative efforts (in your quite useful, broad notion), that's kind of just a dressed-up hedonism...or no?</blockquote></p>

<h3>M&ouml;bius</h3>

<p>There's no manual I'm aware of, except the one we're writing and editing.  Since any sense of meaning is necessarily a social one, I'm curious how others find their materials and what grammar they use to construct sense and order (unabashedly subjective, those) in life.  So share.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I found this in <a href="http://academy.galilean-library.org/showthread.php?t=6693">a discussion about the study in the Galilean Library</a>, which is a wonderful resource for thoughtful, and almost more importantly, civil discussion across the philosophical spectrum.  I added a (typically long-winded) point of consideration, summarized by saying that, as much as "God" might just be a label for the collection of "all things we think we don't know, or which are currently ineffable and beyond our scrutiny," then any such study, however expensive, really aims to investigate just one in a class of cultural metaphors, models, for things we want to understand.</p><!--more-->

<p>There are undoubtedly flaws in viewing all our cognitive endeavors as mere mapping sensation to lingual metaphors, as it is certain to be a crude approximation, if a valid approximation at all; but just as in the case of the <a href="www.phys.virginia.edu/classes/252/FiniteSquareWell/FiniteSquareWell.html">infinite square well</a>, first-order, crude models work well as insertion points to broader and/or deeper analysis.  And lest it be thought that I'm of the same "science != religion" mindset I was just <a href="http://erectlocution.com/boxing/2005/03/30/were-all-jerks/">a few</a> <a href="http://erectlocution.com/boxing/2005/03/29/on-dogged-belief/">short</a> <a href="http://erectlocution.com/boxing/2005/03/15/god-cant-be-dead/">years ago</a>, here's a hopefully fruitful excerpt.
<blockquote>Of course, science itself probably holds no special claim to some objectivity, some circumnavigation of our use of metaphors as models. Just because scientific models use polynomial notation, and are algebraically derivable, and embed quite a lot of effective structure in the mathematical language they inhabit, doesn't mean they're anything more than just intricate metaphors. Niels Bohr developed a pretty model for the atom, but this perfect picture has since been rebutted. It worked, though, and, in many contexts, is a fine picture of atomic structure. Physics students still make use of metaphors in university, e.g. the infinite square well. These are simplified pictures used to motivate a subtle concept, before their complexity is increased on the way to deeper understanding.</blockquote></p>

<p>The specific question about whether belief in "God" conferred/confers an evolutionary benefit is interesting, and something I've pondered for a while.  In general, it seems that people with some kind of workable model prosper to a greater degree than those who don't, independent of the model's approximation of "truth."  This is related, I think, to results of <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=87922568">a study concluding  that those able to deceive themselves tended to be happier than those who aren't</a>, given that (a) models are only ever approximate, and (b) the utility of a model is probably proportionate to how strongly we <em>believe</em> in it's explanatory power.</p>]]></content:encoded>
		<excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The University of Oxford has apparently taken &#163;2M toward answering <a href = "http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article3393198.ece">"Why do we believe in God?"</a>  From the Times article:
<blockquote>They will not attempt to solve the question of whether God exists but they will examine evidence to try to prove whether belief in God conferred an evolutionary advantage to mankind. They will also consider the possibility that faith developed as a byproduct of other human characteristics, such as sociability.</blockquote></p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first point is rather subtle, or seems so given the enthusiasm with which the standard of intelligent design is being raised.  The creative capacity of the human species is lauded as one of the characteristics that significantly separate us from other species, and is fundamental to viewing humans as undoubtedly greater.  We look to our <a href="http://www.amd.com">semiconductor chipsets</a>, our <a href="http://www.wtcsitememorial.org/">skyscrapers</a>, our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Gutenberg">movable type</a>, our <a href="http://www.ccel.org/d/dostoevsky/karamozov/karamozov.html">perfect novels</a>, and our <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/specials/destruction/">weapons of mass destruction</a> and proclaim, awfully, &#147;Holy shit, we own.&#148;  To us, these results of our creative endeavors are without the bounds of nature.</p>

<p>No surprise, then, that upon observing some phenomenon in nature which bears strikingly similar complexity as we've come to understand creations wrought by our hands and minds, we conclude said phenomenon is the product of some creative force.  Of course that force would have to be intelligent, must be conscious and create with intent, because that's what we do.  That force, though, is not human.</p>

<p>Let's assume there is an intelligent designer.  It's no feat whatsoever to <a href = "http://www.skepticreport.com/creationism/vestigial.htm" title = "Skeptical about the Engineer...">find fault with this designer's product</a> (though this is by no means perfectly demonstrative of the claim, as <a href="http://www.godandscience.org/evolution/designgonebad.html">some responses</a> note).  I have also heard, more than once and from more than one source, that engineers interested in the topic generally consider the human body to be poorly engineered.  Our only saving grace, it would seem, is our intelligence, as, without it, we surely would not prosper as we do.  However, a useful argument can be framed which would call even this conclusion into question.  It is a long way from self-evident that we are, in fact, the product of an <em>intelligent</em> designer, if a product of any designer we are.</p>

<p>Proponents of intelligent design might have their bets hedged.  It's likely that someone, upon reading the preceding paragraph, would respond, &#147;Well, sure, maybe the coccyx <em>seems</em> ill-planned; but you can't claim to know the Creator's plan!  You're overstepping the bounds of your understanding, sir, and I'll have none of that.&#148;  To which I would reply, &#147;I was only following your lead, my fellow, given that you've deemed your understanding of nature to be quite conclusive on the matter of what occurs naturally and what must be created to exist.&#148;</p>

<p>&#147;Further,&#148; I'd add, straightening my smoking jacket, &#147;it might appear to the wary observer that it is you who has overstepped the bounds of your understanding more grossly, decided as you have that whatever you might make with some hardware and a free afternoon is beyond the means of the remaining entirety of the universe...except an agent fashioned after humans.  Could it be, rather, that 'creation' is not the province of intelligence at all, but instead just one other dynamic of the universe, like entropy?  Is it really so odd to think that we 'create' because we are wholly within nature, inextricably, and are no less an agent of nature, an organ, than gravity or stars or diseases; and, further, is it really so odd to think that, as an organ of nature, we should propagate a dynamism found elsewhere in nature, producing output which had not been observed prior?  What if 'creation' is a product of the universe, and not vice versa?&#148;</p>

<p>How different, really, are these conceptions?  What is really so different about explaining the development of some observed phenomena with an appeal to this Greatness over that one?  We may debate the details but not the Greatness.  That is, no one really presumes to understand everything about everything, or even everything about much of anything; and whether they're particle physicists or a pastors (or both), no matter in which of these camps they might fall, for each contributor of this large discussion there is a threshold beyond which we seem commonly to say, &#147;Well, beyond that, we just don't know.&#148;</p>]]></content:encoded>
		<excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p>And if it's not, you're doing it wrong.  Which represents the greater hubris: we have found structures in the universe whose origins we can understand only if they were created by a higher consciousness; or given an intelligent creator, whoever that is must've received, like, a C at best for ENG302: Creating Things That Work Well to Populate Your New Universe?</p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[In addition to the "bad design" examples given in the link, one that I find mind-boggling is the laryngeal nerve. Sometime early on in the evolutionary tree, this nerve happened to go from the brain to the aorta around which it looped before ending in the larynx. Now, as the neck of animals enlarged, the "detour" required to loop the aorta got longer and longer. This reaches comical proportions in the giraffe (they had a BBC show on which they dissected a giraffe and saw that the laryngeal nerve takes a detour of more than 10 feet, going all the way down the animals neck, circling its aorta, and coming all the way back up to end in the larynx!).

BTW, I highly recommend watching all those dissections, carried out on large dead animals. The program was available on youtube some months ago. They are tough to stomach, but compulsively watchable.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Even with a balanced coin, it&#039;s no mean feat to make sense of the world.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It doesn't follow, however, that the truth need not be dire.  Invoking fruitlessness or direness as illustrations or proof of absurdity would seem relevant only if we take as given a need for life, a purpose in it other than as a means to excrete and feed other life by dying.  That effectively cuts to the heart of the issue, and begs the question of whether or not humanity exists to serve a designed purpose.</p>

<p>Furthermore, to support a designed Reason via despair in its absence is tantamount to "finding religion" as a means of escapism, and it should be insulting&#151;to the believer.  Clear said, &#147;There are no atheists in foxholes"; and I say that grenades don't make believers.  More than mere delusion, it appears circular: believing in a higher authority as an alternative to a dire life in its absence presupposes that the universe gives a fuck.  Again, that points to the face of the question, and is unconvincing.</p>

<p>Of course life <em>can</em> be desperate.  It has, does, and by all indications, will, from time to time, become so.  I counter that it <em>must</em> be so in the absence of an extrahuman power, man-jerk or otherwise.  I find it unfortunate, both that the believer is oft characterized as a zealous mystic, ignorant of fact; and that the nonbeliever is characterized as suffering from a melancholic humor, lost and listless.</p>

<p>To say that death is the only viable option in a world without an intrinsic, enterprising purpose is to say that life lived for its own sake is not viable.  If a morality devoid of extrahuman stewardship requires no distinction between raping and not raping, then there can't be any differentiation between the choice to live and the choice to die.  Even if the world of the nonbeliever is this absurd, there still is no <em>de facto</em> reason for suicide.  Even if life is nothing more than a protracted process of cellular division and decay, of conversion of energy into food into energy, why is living not a justifiable choice?</p>

<p>Consider, then, that even the nonbeliever can accommodate a belief in something grander than himself: an elegant proof; a refinement of a physical theory; the next quirky thing your son says.  All are informing, all contribute to making you more than you were before them.  Even oppression, persecution, and assault are potentially additive, if variably unpleasant.  Those who don't believe it was <em>created</em> are not necessarily restricted from admiring the natural world&#151;this is no one's special province.</p>

<p>I awake each morning and rise, not because today will be better than yesterday; but because today is today, and is not yesterday.</p>]]></content:encoded>
		<excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Upon cursory reading, <a href = "http://www.ccel.org/c/chesterton/orthodoxy/" title = "Orthodoxy by G.K. Chesterton">Chesterton</a> also makes several comments to this effect, though madness, not simple despair, is his result.  I concur: it's quite daunting to have none but yourself to rely upon for guidance and whatever "purpose" can be had.</p>]]></excerpt:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My name is Daniel Black. I am on the internet. I am a person. I am a father and a husband. I <a href="http://erectlocution.com/2011/01/23/on-december-12-2010-i-graduated-from-the-university-of-cincinnati-with-a-degree-in-mathematics/">was</a> a <a href="http://www.uc.edu">university</a> student of mathematics (<a href="http://www.muohio.edu">originally</a> math and physics). I am a less formalized student of thinking, of <a href="http://academy.galilean-library.org/index.php">philosophy</a>, of writing, and of how to make decisions.</p><p>I have had some kind of website for approaching ten years, mostly on but once or twice off. Despite my expectations to the contrary, I never applied much editorial direction to my writing, which as often as not led me to waste any reader's time with yet more blathering on some controversial topic of the day. There is a place for that; as of now, <em>this</em> is not <a href="http://erectlocution.com/boxing/">that place</a>.</p><p>I am a <a href="http://www.linux.org">Linux</a> user. I appreciate what <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> rolls out, but I'm much more comfortable in a pretty bare <a href="http://www.slackware.com">Slackware</a> setup. For most of my tenure as a Slackware user, I used <a href="http://icculus.org/openbox/index.php/Main_Page">OpenBox</a> as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager">window manager</a>, but after purchasing my first new computer in a decade, I decided to let <a href="http://www.kde.org">KDE</a> tempt me. It's worked so far.</p><p>I won't say I &quot;enjoy photography.&quot; That's such a castrated statement. I have a cameraâa <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pentax_products">Pentax</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pentax_products#P_Series">P3</a>âand I've started keeping it closer and loaded with film. I recently read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bryan-Peterson/e/B000APQPTU/ref=ep_sprkl_at_B000APQPTU?pf_rd_p=482609291&amp;pf_rd_s=auto-sparkle&amp;pf_rd_t=301&amp;pf_rd_i=bryan%20peterson&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=0J8VWVK0VGC4AZCA6SFN">Bryan Peterson</a>'s <em>Understanding Exposure</em>, c. 1990, and as much as it covers fundamentals, it does so in the engaging fashion of learning something slowly and patiently. My camera is a 35mm film camera, and has few automatic functions. Certainly, aperture priority is the most useful of them, but I've shot less than a handful of frames on that setting. I'm learning, so the less automation the better.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hidden somewhere in my DNA is whatever code whose execution makes me need community.  I don't pretend to understand it, and I'm nearing the end of my too-cool aloofness toward the idea of sharing my concern with others, even putting theirs above mine.  Each time I roll my eyes at Christian goodness expressed as a bumper sticker, I'm hoping someone sees it.  I want to share my weak outrage, cleverly if possible.</p>

<p>I suffer the fools, nodding with a forced grin, or, more frequently these days, a committal nonchalance, a disaffection.  I try not to enable their insipidity.  My working hypothesis is that I can condition people to spare me their American Idol gossip and formulaic well wishes, this hypothesis underpinned by the presumption that they proffer the former to justify their interest, and the latter at the behest of perceived cultural obligation.  Neither, then, is anything better than the misapplication of earnestness, a motive earnestness powering a crass social algorithm.</p>

<p>Whatever the quality of the hypothesis, I am yet not quite the good scientist.  While you may rest your willing suspension of disbelief of the meaninglessness of our entire venture on a fetish for familial melodrama, I am just as easily duped into giving a damn by the ignorant wagging of a small dog's tail.  There's no sound nihilistic conclusion that doesn't undermine the value of both.</p>

<h3>On Community</h3>

<p>In our best moments, people and I dance like we've been at it for years, like we took lessons and we know what we're doing.  We finally cave and celebrate Christmas, because, damn it, it's as good an excuse as any to get together and laugh and talk about the good old times and make yet another promise to stay in touch and yes I mean it this time.  They've got a way of confusing me, people do, making me forget for a moment the difficulty of thinking deeply about continued existence without concluding that it's ludicrous.  I can get lost in that attachment.  I can want a social life, a life filled with people and their straining against credulity to believe in the President or their political parties or how wonderful their children are.  I can get lost in it, because I want their illusions to be true, because it makes those first steps out of bed each morning easier to take.</p>

<p>Convinced that I can circumnavigate banality by choosing to associate with like-minded folks, I seek them out, find them, and usually make them regret having admitted to a shared interest.  I have gone so far as to bemoan the absence of this social cloud, blaming my fractured attentiveness to fields of my interest on the fact that I've no one of whom to ask for help and no one to whom to offer it.  <em>If only I could surround myself with ambient similarity of intent and disposition</em>, I suppose, <em>I'd finally earn my pride</em>.</p>

<p>There's logic in that, of course.  There are fewer things any one of us can do better alone than there are things better suited to multiple effort, and individual aptitude doesn't scale well.  And maybe my American pedigree comes with too great a focus on not only genius, but on solitary genius, the single brilliant point in all the surrounding murky darkness.  Too great, as I've only just seen my way through it and started learning that genius doesn't exist, that the question isn't even relevant to any substantive success.  No, whatever our natural aptitude, it's our work that achieves; and work is about the goal, independent of whether we reached out for help or soldiered on in private.</p>

<h3>The Teachers Lounge</h3>

<p>I have this idea, right?  I've tinkered with it, and I'm convinced it's a winner.  It's about a coffee house, but not Starbucks or that local shop you go to to keep it real.  No, this is a shop with coffee, and healthy snacks, and white- and/or chalkboards, and computers loaded with fancy math software.  And books&mdash;oh, the books.  Shelves of canonical tomes, of Newton and Euclid and Euler and Gauss.  Lesser works, too, but nothing without rigor.  The real stars, though, are the customers.</p>

<p>They're math geeks, physics geeks, engineers in fact or aspiration, hackers and crypto wonks, and the taggers-along who dig the nerd scene.  You could float from one table to the next and overhear all manner of esoteric enthusiasm; and you could watch the hasty cycle of writing, erasing, lip-chewing, and writing at the boards, two or three contributors locked on a proof or a messy optics problem.  All the reference material you'd ever need, all the theorems and algorithms and particle masses, are sitting on the shelves, in multiplicity.  You could just soak it in, and maybe learn a thing or two.</p>

<p>Or, rather, I could.  Ambient similarity of intent and disposition + ready access to coffee and geeks.  And I own the place, which means all the business is <em>my</em> business; and it means that I've made it out of the cube farm and into the fold.  No longer on part-time terms, I'm a full-time, fully vested member of that community.  I'd call this place The Teachers Lounge.</p>

<h3>The Nothing</h3>

<p>Despite the eagerness with which I hang it, there's a window behind all that window dressing, and it opens out into a void.  All our efforts, all our cares, all our lofty endeavors, all our conniving and violence and pity, all of it breaks down to a single concern: survival.  Depending on the scope, survival of the individual or survival of the species; but each of our urges to survive arises from similar genetic heritage, so the former is just an instance of the latter.  How, then, can survival actually mean anything, really?  If we matter to more than ourselves, I have yet to see how.  Put those things together&mdash;that all our business is merely survival, and that our existence bears no objective worth&mdash;then our business is not itself imbued with intrinsic value.  We must give it any value it has.</p>

<p>But the form of this value varies across cultures, measured nationally or racially or ethnically or socioeconomically, so we can't even provide a sake for life other than life itself.  This value is for each of us to assign if it is to be nontrivial, which is problematic.  It's problematic because the shared vision, the community, is in its sparest incarnation a search for authenticity, of an authority for evaluation; if we can each count on no one else but ourselves to define our value, then the community offers false hope at best, confusion or worse otherwise.</p>

<p>I'll skirt an invocation of Godwin's law and instead generically assert that history provides us many glaring examples of vicarious valuation gone wrong.  Wherever there is a prostration to the wisdom of crowds, there stands a good chance for disaster and mayhem, though we might merely suffer banality instead.  And we're back where we started.</p>

<h3>Alas</h3>

<p>I have a few projects in mind that revolve around a surprisingly resilient interest in sharing something with a group of people.  Most are more immediately tenable than The Teachers Lounge.  I've decided&mdash;again, but more resolutely now&mdash;to give this community thing a serious whirl.  I'm anticipating making use of the extra computing power; for anything my brain can crunch, mine and someone else's might do it better and/or faster.  And there are some prospects for sustainable business models among them, too.  But most of all, I'm interested in collecting data and testing my hypotheses.  Maybe I'm wrong, maybe there's some kind of meaning hidden away in the spaces between us.  I don't think so, I'm not expecting much, and I'm not quite beyond feeling I'm selling out.  Alas, there is but to give it a shot.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm still trying to figure out what I think about that. I started in February of 1998, studying physics at <a href="http://muohio.edu">Miami University (Ohio)</a>, and soon after decided that I might as well pursue a dual math/physics major. Some years later, logistical practicality prevailed, and I chose to study only mathematics. I'm still skeptical that I ever did.
<!--more-->
I'd come to define myself, in part, in terms of this studenthood. Between first registration and final grade tally, I married once twice and divorced once. I saw two daughters come into the world, and one leave it. I bought a house, divested myself of that house, and bought another. I accepted the job I've had for a decade, and which I've spent the last few hoping to leave. Always, actively or in that part of my forebrain where ego and regret collide, I was a student.

And now I'm not. Now I'm "done." I expect my diploma in the mail soon, and I will hang it in our office proudly. Though...though it'll represent not so much a goal reached, but the closing of a personal epoch. An end to a struggle I never fully joined. A curtain call for the döppelganger, the ostensible student. And a beginning of my real education.

Not that I haven't learned anything; that'd be a bit melodramatic and glib. I've learned that <a href="http://www.stewartcalculus.com/">the Stewart calculus text</a> is a credible device for (a) teaching various recipes for mathematical cooking, e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L'H%C3%B4pital's_rule">L'Hopital's Rule</a>; and for (b) scaring students into believing they're "<a href="http://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf">bad at math</a>."

I've learned enough of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann">Riemann</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin-Louis_Cauchy">Cauchy</a> to have a first-order approximation of how much yet there is to know. I've learned some of the basic lexicon of mathematics, of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_(topology)">continuity</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space">metric spaces</a>, of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_subgroup">normal subgroups</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphism">homomorphisms</a>. With a little review, I could even do something with them.

Which is to say, I've also learned what it is to truly study a subject. Well, actually, I suppose I can't claim that: a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?ei=QsY8TaTKNYL48Aapw-HJCg&ct=result&id=lic72KLZq-0C&dq=godel+escher+bach&q=recursively+enumerable#search_anchor">recursively enumerable set isn't necessarily a recursive set</a>, which is to say that my knowing that I did not truly study a subject doesn't confer to me knowledge of what it is to study it. Another first-order approximation, then. But useful nonetheless.

Now there is but to finally carry the mantel of student, freed from the illusion that completing repetitive problem sets on line integrals or expectation values actually constitutes more than a cheap rip-off of mathematics. What I've gleaned from this at-once trivial and enlightening realization applies not only to <em>my</em> development, but also to that of my children. What I've gleaned is that, even if these cobblestone streets were paved with good intentions, what we generally refer to as "education" is at its very best vocational training, and is at its very worst a commoditizing of our <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2008/09/10/time-attention-creative-work">time and attention</a>, of our will to power.

I failed as a student in more ways than I have the patience to note at the moment. Among this litany is my failure to form any academic community. I'm not sure how much I missed out on, but I bet it's substantial. I'm a product of my passive-aggressive heuristic for dealing with people, characterized by idolizing my antisocial tendencies and then lamenting my lack of human connection. This failure as a student is my failure as a person, notwithstanding the logistical challenges a parent-student faces.

I'm officially done with this particular rant. I've really drained myself by alternating self-congratulation and "Woe is me." I created what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Rogers">Carl Rogers</a> might call a self-image at odds with reality: every Einstein quote, every time I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119217/"><em>Good Will Hunting</em></a>, every browsing of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss">Carl Friedrich Gauss'</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Tao">Terrance Tao</a>'s Wikipedia pages, contributed to the fantasy that I would, or more importantly, should, be similarly prodigious and capable. My particular knot of neurons and ganglia translated that information into a proscription against hard work, as if I shouldn't need to work hard, as if instead I should need only to surround myself with the trappings of genius to <em>free</em> genius. And that, that's the most important thing I've learned.

My most ambitious academic product is stored <a href="http://erectlocution.com/computabilityFinalDraft_100816.pdf" title="PDF">here</a> (LaTeX file <a href="http://erectlocution.com/computabilityFinalDraft_100816.tex" title="LaTeX">here</a>). It's an interesting, short paper I all but transcribed from my faculty advisor's notes. I did learn a bit about computability, and <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>, and I enjoyed the process. Now I'm moving on, perhaps to study mathematics.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Patterns develop. Stimuli arriving in near-simultaneity become linked structurally. Impressions are formed, impressions in the physical structure of the brain, affecting the strength and reach of signal passage. The brain grows in sophistication, in connectedness. Basic if not simple functions, those coded for in DNA, are used as the building blocks of yet higher connections and functions. We bend the brain's capacity to detect visual features, like vertical, horizontal, and diagonal lines, into the ability to recognize a chair or a face. We feel pain, associate it with the visual and spatial attributes of the stovetop, and learn to avoid it with our fingers.</p>
<p>We begin with simple atomic units, and build.</p>
<p>Some few layers beyond, after spending years bathed in sensory data, sorting it by building stronger pathways when they're helpful and diminishing others when not, the brain has a refined capacity for parsing impressions of the world. It develops a sensory algebra for referring to the world through the senses. We begin to see that the world includes us, that we are in the world, and refine our reference frame such that by echoing our worldview back against the world, we can see our shadow upon it. We are now self-aware.</p>
<p>Thereafter, we have larger units built upon all those smaller ones. We are a unit, an algebraic element, as is the seen world, the heard world, the felt world, the smelled world, the tasted world. We are now world-aware, in a local sense, as that locality follows us.</p>
<p>At some point, before or after, we find a curious application of these patterns: they can be encoded and transferred. We call this language, including but not limited to the grammatical spoken and written languages. With this phenomenon arrives the possibility of creating algebraic elements which are actually only references to others, and the ability to combine these references into yet larger references, systematically. What the world <em>is</em> is reshaped as we fold sensory data into lingual structures, as we see a dog and understand her to be a "dog" and then read <em>Old Yeller</em>.</p>
<p>In this way, electrical signals passing through neuron gaps, down myelin-sheathed neuron fibers, across networks of fibers and gaps, form higher-order structures, which in turn form yet higher-order structure, and so on, until our "instincts" (whatever those are) are joined by our cognitive machinery to create our world. Just as a brick house is made of walls, which are made of brick, which are made of compacted clay and sediment, and so on, the space which our cognition occupies evolves from more fundamental blocks.</p>
<p>We may--and many people do--call this process or its result "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogy" title="&apos;Analogy&apos; on Wikipedia">analogy</a>." I describe it as the inference of structure via the combination of available cognitive elements, at least for now. It forms the basis for subsequent discussion.</p>]]></content:encoded>
		<excerpt:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Across billions of neurons, mapped not quite chaotically, but with only that structure which provides for rudimentary autonomic function and the building blocks for more. For cognition, for personhood. As we receive stimuli, we change the structure of this web of pathways. Some grow stronger, others weaken and atrophy.</p>]]></excerpt:encoded>
