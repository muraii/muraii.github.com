      <summary type="html">Several times across several different online publishing systems and over 15 years, nevermind paper journals, I've lamented about the delta between my actual and my preferred existential experience. I resisted for some time, and still sometimes do, becoming an active component of the human social web.</summary>

      <summary type="html">I realize it's a little silly to think there is a single book or source regardless of medium that will settle my mathematical ills. Depending on the scale chosen, that settlement will require one, a few, all, or all possible books, nevermind that the field will certainly outstrip any possible number of published summaries. Mathematics as a collection of fields is verdant. It grows. Within it, probablity and statistics--which many may consider largely exhausted--continue to adapt and find new soil in which to take root.</summary>

      <summary type="html">(Nevermind that I seem not to have actually asked anything.) I'm still in the same boat but am considering a different approach. I [mentioned](https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/source-for-autodidactic-learning-of-data-analysis-techniques.744324/) that I felt approaching practical (mostly work) and theoretical problems on my own was like &quot;a random walk through the space of modelling techniques and undergirding theory.&quot; I've looked into graduate programs and tried to form working relationships with potential mentors, but my schedule and rural home make this somewhat difficult.</summary>

      <summary type="html">There's a reason (probably several) we evolved a capacity for it. I don't know why, though I'm sure we've got some guesses. Let's say, though, that we strip away connotations, let anger be just as valid a response as glee or trepidation. You're free to be as angry as you want, whenever you want. Except? Yeah, except you've got a budget. Like dopamine and fat, anger has a utility but too much probably isn't doing you any favors. Moderation. But holy hell, guys, moderation is tough, requires a lot of patience and nuance and I don't know about you but I'm trying to figure out so many things all at once that please, Moderation, you could be a little easier, dude.</summary>

      <summary type="html">Patterns develop. Stimuli arriving in near-simultaneity become linked structurally. Impressions are formed, impressions in the physical structure of the brain, affecting the strength and reach of signal passage. The brain grows in sophistication, in connectedness. Basic if not simple functions, those coded for in DNA, are used as the building blocks of yet higher connections and functions. We bend the brain's capacity to detect visual features, like vertical, horizontal, and diagonal lines, into the ability to recognize a chair or a face. We feel pain, associate it with the visual and spatial attributes of the stovetop, and learn to avoid it with our fingers.</summary>

      <summary type="html">I'm still trying to figure out what I think about that. I started in February of 1998, studying physics at [Miami University (Ohio)](http://muohio.edu), and soon after decided that I might as well pursue a dual math/physics major. Some years later, logistical practicality prevailed, and I chose to study only mathematics. I'm still skeptical that I ever did.</summary>

I may be awed by a feat of community, only to be horrified by the quickness of depravity. Hot and cold. Hidden somewhere in my DNA is whatever code whose execution makes me need community. I don't pretend to understand it, and I'm nearing the end of my too-cool aloofness toward the idea of sharing my concern with others, even putting theirs above mine. Each time I roll my eyes at Christian goodness expressed as a bumper sticker, I'm hoping someone sees it. I want to share my weak outrage, cleverly if possible.</summary>

We accept that all our knowledge is approximation, and *need* it to be so.</summary>

      <summary type="html">It's quite daunting to have only yourself to rely upon for guidance toward purpose. It doesn't follow, however, that the truth need not be dire. Invoking fruitlessness or direness as illustrations or proof of absurdity would seem relevant only if we take as given a need for life, a purpose in it other than as a means to excrete and feed other life by dying. That effectively cuts to the heart of the issue, and begs the question of whether or not humanity exists to serve a designed purpose.</summary>
