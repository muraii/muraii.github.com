      <summary type="html">For too long now I&#39;ve harrassed and harried those closest to me with an increasingly &amp;ldquo;eclectic&amp;rdquo; (read&amp;#58;&amp;ldquo;What the hell is this already?&amp;rdquo;) stream of links to pit stops on the information superhighway, be they articles I think are of interest or arrestingly funny things about cats or nihilism.</summary>

      <summary type="html">Spring approaches, same as every year, notwithstanding some noisiness in the date or intensity of its approach. What to look forward to? New Year&#39;s resolutions feel so preemptive or even premature. Might prefer spring resolutions, when the motive energy for improvement is at the ready goading us on to our illusions of future productivity.</summary>

      <summary type="html">This is motivated not least by the NSA kerfluffle and other wrong-doing, the decades-long attempts by governing bodies to stifle the tools for their citizens to express themselves, especially _as_ a citizenry corralling their governing bodies, and the increasing ease with which anyone with an unimpressive fluency with digital technology can make endroads around security and good intentions.</summary>

      <summary type="html">I realize it&#39;s a little silly to think there is a single book or source regardless of medium that will settle my mathematical ills. Depending on the scale chosen, that settlement will require one, a few, all, or all possible books, nevermind that the field will certainly outstrip any possible number of published summaries. Mathematics as a collection of fields is verdant. It grows. Within it, probablity and statistics--which many may consider largely exhausted--continue to adapt and find new soil in which to take root.</summary>

    <title>A few months ago I asked for recommendations for textbooks on GLM.</title>

      <summary type="html">(Nevermind that I seem not to have actually asked anything.) I&#39;m still in the same boat but am considering a different approach. I [mentioned](https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/source-for-autodidactic-learning-of-data-analysis-techniques.744324/) that I felt approaching practical (mostly work) and theoretical problems on my own was like &quot;a random walk through the space of modelling techniques and undergirding theory.&quot; I&#39;ve looked into graduate programs and tried to form working relationships with potential mentors, but my schedule and rural home make this somewhat difficult.</summary>

      <summary type="html">I&#39;m still trying to figure out what I think about that. I started in February of 1998, studying physics at [Miami University (Ohio)](http://muohio.edu), and soon after decided that I might as well pursue a dual math/physics major. Some years later, logistical practicality prevailed, and I chose to study only mathematics. I&#39;m still skeptical that I ever did.</summary>
