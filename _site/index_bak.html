<p>Today it occurred to me that with so many rich tools available <em>on the line</em>, and especially as I so highly value the asynchronicity with which people can communicate using them (read: "I'm not in the right mood now and I'll be grumpy if you require me to stop my <em>Important Thing &trade;</em> to read about the future of humanity"), there is a better way.</p>

<p>Starting today I'm going to begin collecting these curios in one Dropbox Paper document per person. It'll give me a chance to see what Dropbox Paper's about, and will allow me to manage a pretty diverse set of rich media. One of the things I appreciate about Slack is its fetching a preview of most links and such, and embedding playable video, so no one needs to open another thing to enjoy the stuff. Essentially, I'm recreating the tumblelog but in a more-intimate, bespoke way. At least until I get tired of it (read: "It's the internet I can't get tired of it").</p>

<p>If I'm truly industriously ambitious&mdash;or ambitiously industrious&mdash;I'll make some kind of hack tool that lets me do this very quickly. But this is unlikely! The more time I spend making things, the more of the internet that just rushes by, unseen, unloved, lonely.</p>

            <p>I realize it's a little silly to think there is a single book or source regardless of medium that will settle my mathematical ills. Depending on the scale chosen, that settlement will require one, a few, all, or all possible books, nevermind that the field will certainly outstrip any possible number of published summaries. Mathematics as a collection of fields is verdant. It grows. Within it, probablity and statistics--which many may consider largely exhausted--continue to adapt and find new soil in which to take root.</p>

I <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/source-for-autodidactic-learning-of-data-analysis-techniques.744324/">mentioned</a> that I felt approaching practical (mostly work) and theoretical problems on my own was like "a random walk through the space of modelling techniques and undergirding theory." I've looked into graduate programs and tried to form working relationships with potential mentors, but my schedule and rural home make this somewhat difficult.</p>
