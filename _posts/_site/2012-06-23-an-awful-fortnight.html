<p>“I need a good idea.”</p>

<p>“Charity simulation. It’s like Jerry’s kids but recursive or something.” Jonas waves his hands, apparently trying to invoke recursion somatically.</p>

<p>“That’s good, but that’s drama, Peep. Mom can’t stomach.” My hands are still.</p>

<p>“Alright, alright. Try…what’s this for?” I told him, what, eight minutes ago?</p>

<p>“It’s like Ludum Dare, but in meatspace.”</p>

<p>“We said no Gibson.”</p>

<p>“Pretty sure he never wrote that. Sounds derivative. So–”</p>

<p>“So you need something gonzo, like, what kind of game mechanics do you have in mind?” He sips his lukewarm coffee as if it might still be hot.</p>

<p>I pause.</p>

<p>I unpause. “Costumes, of course. We provide materials, for some value of ‘materials’, and a time limit.”</p>

<p>“Time limits <em>are</em> materials. Constraint.”</p>

<p>“Pretty sure Gibson’s a pedant. Defect to Canadia from Americania, that’s pedantry. So, foul.”</p>

<p>Jonas bites his lip, then appears to forget the matter. “Fine, okay. Costumes? Are they going to have a theme? Monsters, maybe, for some value of ‘monsters’?”</p>

<p>“I can swing that. It’ll be boring though if we don’t give them a wide berth. But how does that have anything to do with charity?”</p>

<p>“Daft. Jerry’s a monster, charities fight monsters. Got it at both ends. Charity can’t exist in a monstrous vacuum.” Jonas plays with his hat. He looks so simple.</p>

<p>I scribble notes. I scratch most of them out. We’re two hours into coffee and saltines, eating like poorly coached endurance athletes. My gut is tight with urine and sodium. It’s like 1987 except Jonas doesn’t wear the eyepatch anymore.</p>

<p>“Is nude a costume?” he says. His face couldn’t be straighter. “I mean, less Kubrick, more Burroughs.”</p>

<p>“Edgar Rice or Billy S.?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I call a wide berth.”</p>

<p>“You’re a gem, Peep,” I say. “One guy’s, like, a jungle warrior, a machete in each hand, dangling the goods–”</p>

<p>“Ironically.”</p>

<p>“Dangling the goods ironically, however that works.”</p>

<p>“Is this Billy S.? ‘Cause that’s how.”</p>

<p>“I’m thinking Billy shows up in the buff with ‘big rats’ painted on his distended abdomen. Eddy G. doesn’t know from irony, so the goods dangle plain-like.”</p>

<p>Jonas nods. Jonas stops nodding to open his mouth and ask, “But where are the games?”</p>

<p><em>Shit</em>, I think. I take a moment, then ask, “You seen ‘Shalom Baskur’?”</p>
