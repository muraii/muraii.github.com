<!--Happiness or contentedness aren't scalar values. They're vectors. They have orientation and degree. Deriving them often feels like optimizing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation#Time-dependent_equation">time-dependent Schrödinger wave equation</a>. And just like the wave equation, it's not always clear how fitting such labor is. I suppose if you define your roll such that the activity is a necessary component thereof, e.g., you study particle physics and so need to solve for quantum states, then the fit is clear. Life is undefined in any solution space that necessitates happiness or contentedness.-->
