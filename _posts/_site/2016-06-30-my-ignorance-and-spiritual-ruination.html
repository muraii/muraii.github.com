<!-- My ignorance and spiritual ruination now exposed, let's move on a bit. Some of the ways I've attempted to jump-start&mdash;borrowing from Ayn Rand here because I like how she puts it&mdash;a "motive energy" is by creating to-do lists and projects and even a mind map or two. These incantations, designed for folks with energy and focus who merely need organization, don't retroactively _generate_ energy and focus. As (Merlin Mann)[http://merlinmann.com] might say if he were less elegant and more self-derivative, creating a bullet list of things to do without the wherewithal or considered interest in their completion is like buying a chair about jogging. So (first, care)[http://www.43folders.com/2010/02/05/first-care].-->

<p>In short, this cargo cult approach doesn’t work. At all. It’s worse, actually, than being merely nonfunctional; it’s <em>dysfunctional</em>. The added stress of both managing <em>and</em> failing to meet these objectives strongly exacerbates the sense of looming failure. It adds degrees of failure, like a geology of failure, with strata and sediment of disappointment and self-deprecation, and below it all the fossils of dreams long ago crushed. The sad, bitter petroleum, which may yet be refined into industriousness but which nevertheless almost always creates toxic byproducts.</p>

<p>Here is where I’d write the preamble to a hopeful resolution, starting with a coy “However”, a come-hither wink, and rolling into some tips for riding entropy without drowning. Maybe if I were writing a self-help blog or an “article” that’d be picked up by <a href="http://outbrain.com">Outbrain</a>. But all I have left for now is that I’m just trying to tread water and learn to swim. Again.</p>
