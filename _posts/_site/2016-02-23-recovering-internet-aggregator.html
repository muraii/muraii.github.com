<p>Today it occurred to me that with so many rich tools available <em>on the line</em>, and especially as I so highly value the asynchronicity with which people can communicate using them (read: “I’m not in the right mood now and I’ll be grumpy if you require me to stop my <em>Important Thing ™</em> to read about the future of humanity”), there is a better way.</p>

<p>Starting today I’m going to begin collecting these curios in one Dropbox Paper document per person. It’ll give me a chance to see what Dropbox Paper’s about, and will allow me to manage a pretty diverse set of rich media. One of the things I appreciate about Slack is its fetching a preview of most links and such, and embedding playable video, so no one needs to open another thing to enjoy the stuff. Essentially, I’m recreating the tumblelog but in a more-intimate, bespoke way. At least until I get tired of it (read: “It’s the internet I can’t get tired of it”).</p>

<p>If I’m truly industriously ambitious—or ambitiously industrious—I’ll make some kind of hack tool that lets me do this very quickly. But this is unlikely! The more time I spend making things, the more of the internet that just rushes by, unseen, unloved, lonely.</p>
