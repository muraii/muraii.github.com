excerpt: It's true, insofar as a four-word sentence can be true. I don't celebrate it. I don't practice it in any conscious fashion, though I certainly do consciously act in ways that are misogynistic.

<!-- It's true, insofar as a four-word sentence can be true. I don't celebrate it. I don't practice it in any conscious fashion, though I certainly do consciously act in ways that are misogynistic.-->

I can get away with it. I _have_ for somewhere on the order of 30 years, based on my half-baked notion of the legal age of reason. More than this, I have perpetuated misogyny, almost certainly among my sons and my daughters. I am an agent of oppression. This is the most reasonable assessment of my behavior.

I am increasingly conscious of how hard it has been to see this truth. It's lazy to hide behind systemic power structures, to say, "My priviledge as a straight white man in America blinds me to the reality of oppression" but it's still true. Thanks to recent conversations and campaigns on the subject, it's becoming easier to see and begin the work of tearing it away.

That's it. No punchline. Just facts.
