excerpt: I am on the internet. I am a person. I am a father and a husband. I studies [mathematics](http://erectlocution.com/2011/01/23/on-december-12-2010-i-graduated-from-the-university-of-cincinnati-with-a-degree-in-mathematics/) (originally physics as well). I ruminate about thinking and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Style-Conversations-Art-2nd/dp/0130257133/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1248544415&sr=8-1">writing</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory">how to make decisions</a>. Professionally I look for compelling intersections of data capture, analysis, and storytelling.</p>

I have had some kind of website since the early 2000's, mostly on but once or twice off. I've written about politics, about mathematics and physics, about trying to be a partner and parent, and about trying to be happy. Most of it's scattered to the winds more or less, which is fine.

There used to be more here, a kind of personal colophon, about what Linux distro or camera I used, and the like. None of that forwards any particularly interesting projects, and is something of a throwback to days gone by. I'll see if I can get some [Side B](http://twitter.com/fireland) up in this piece.
