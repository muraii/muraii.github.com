<p>So I ignore lyrics mostly because people can't write well and inevitably their songs are about the same mundane offal as everyone else's. I'm listening to the music for the same reason I'm doing anything else: to build my narrative. So I use it how I see fit, take that creative license. I identify with what the music is saying, what the vocal tones are saying, and don't pay much mind to the words. Even when I understand what the singer's singing, and can get the message, and even if I sing along, and even if I might identify with it a little, it's mostly by virtue of how the lyrics fit into the experience. I'm unlikely to read them by themselves.</p>
